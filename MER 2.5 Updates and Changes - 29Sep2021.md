# MER 2.5 Updates
[See here for previous versions](https://github.com/OpenConceptLab/msp_metadata/wiki/Full-List---MER-Key-Updates-and-Changes)


## New Additions to MER 2.5

### New Indicators

* There are no new indicators for MER 2.5.

### New Disaggregations

* **OVC_SERV**: OVC_SERV has been restructured to distinguish between beneficiaries in the three OVC_SERV program models: OVC Comprehensive, DREAMS, and OVC Preventive. The OVC Comprehensive disaggregate is reported by program participation status, age/sex, Exited or Transferred, and a new disaggregate to distinguish between OVC child beneficiaries aged 18-20 years and caregivers aged 18+. The DREAMS and OVC Preventive disaggregates are reported by age/sex.

## Adjustments from MER 2.4

### Changes in Reporting Frequency

* **PrEP_NEW**: The reporting frequency moves from semi-annually to quarterly in FY21.

* **PrEP_CURR**: The reporting frequency moves from semi-annually to quarterly in FY21.

* **GEND_GBV**: The reporting frequency moves from annually to semi-annually in FY21.

### Modifications to Existing Indicators

* **KP_PREV**: In order to standardize KP disaggregations across the clinical cascade indicators, KP_PREV disaggregations were updated to: FSW, MSM, PWID, TG, and People in prisons and other closed settings. The disaggregations of TG SW, TG non-SW, MSM SW, MSM non-SW, PWID male, and PWID female were retired.

### Indicator Definition Clarifications

* **OVC_HIVSTAT**: Clarifying language was added to state that the denominator of OVC_HIVSTAT will be auto-calculated from the OVC_SERV “OVC Comprehensive” disaggregate. Only beneficiaries enrolled in the OVC Comprehensive program should be reported in OVC_HIVSTAT.

* **TX_RTT**: Language was added to TX_RTT to state that patients reported in TX_RTT must have been experienced an interruption in treatment during any previous reporting period, successfully restarted ARVs within the current reporting period, and remained on treatment until the end of the reporting period.

* **TX_ML**: Clarifying language was added to outline the relationship between TX_ML and TX_RTT.

### Language Changes

* The following changes were made in order use patient-centered language:
Retention was changed to “continuity of treatment”.
Lost to Follow-Up (LTFU) was changed to “interruption in treatment”. Interruption in treatment (IIT) is defined as no clinical contact or ARV drug pickup for greater than 28 days since the last expected contact.

### Central Support

* Financial support at the national or subnational level in areas where PEPFAR is not providing support at the site level is characterized as Central Support. Starting in FY21, PEPFAR Central Support will be collected as third support type, separate from DSD and TA. TX_PVLS will be added to the list of Central Support indicators. Central Support data will continue to be reported annually. For additional information, please refer to the section on PEPFAR Support to Communities and Sites.

## Removals from MER 2.4

### Retired Indicators

* **HRH_CURR**: Starting in FY21, HRH_CURR will be retired. HRH Data will be collected via the HRH Inventory. Data collection through the HRH Inventory, along with more robust analysis and programmatic action, will allow PEPFAR to better capture the scope and nature of its staffing investments in order to optimize health worker utilization to advance epidemic control and inform sustainability planning once epidemic control is achieved. See Appendix G for additional information.

Specifically, this indicator will measure how many active DREAMS beneficiaries have completed the DREAMS primary package of services/interventions, the primary package plus any secondary services/interventions, and how many have not yet completed the primary package. _Of note, a DREAMS Beneficiary_ is when an AGYW is enrolled in DREAMS and has started or completed at least one DREAMS service/intervention. 

_**Who is Captured Under AGYW_PREV:**_ 

AGYW should only be counted under AGYW_PREV if they are an _**active**_ DREAMS beneficiary (see below for definition of active beneficiary). The graphic and definitions below outline the client flow for this indicator in more detail, as aligned with the DREAMS program completion continuum: 

_Enrolled:_ AGYW identified based on country-specific eligibility criteria/assessment for HIV risk and accepts enrollment into the DREAMS program. 

While a vulnerability assessment and/or enrollment screening may be a prerequisite to receiving a DREAMS service, the enrollment or screening by itself is not considered a qualifying DREAMS service under this indicator. AGYW and female OVC who are within the 10-24 age band but do not meet DREAMS criteria and have not been enrolled in DREAMS should not be counted in this indicator. They should instead be counted under other MER indicators such as OVC_SERV or PP_PREV as relevant to the definition of these indicators and the services that they receive. 

_DREAMS Beneficiary:_ AGYW is enrolled in DREAMS and has started or completed at least one DREAMS service/intervention. 

_**Active DREAMS Beneficiary:**_ **AGYW is enrolled in DREAMS and has started or completed at least one DREAMS service/intervention in the past 6 months (at Q2) or 12 months (at Q4). Only active DREAMS beneficiaries are counted under AGYW_PREV.** 

_Inactive DREAMS Beneficiary:_ AGYW is enrolled in DREAMS and at one time had started or completed at least one DREAMS service/intervention but has not started or completed a service/intervention within the past 6 months (at Q2) or 12 months (at Q4). 

**_Defining the Country-Specific DREAMS Package:_** 

Each country is responsible for designating its own primary package of services/interventions for each DREAMS AGYW age band (10-14, 15-19 and 20-24) based on the [DREAMS Guidance](https://www.pepfar.net/Project-Pages/collab-49/Shared%20Documents/Tools%20and%20Guiding%20Documents/Current%20DREAMS%20Guidance.pdf). All 15 DREAMS countries will be required to submit a DREAMS Layering Table detailing their primary/secondary/contextual interventions for each age band to OGAC on an annual basis. 

* Primary services/interventions are defined as interventions that ALL AGYW in an age group should receive if they are enrolled in DREAMS in an OU. 

* Secondary services/interventions are needs-based interventions that are part of an OU’s DREAMS core package but may not be received by all AGYW in that age group (i.e., only AGYW who experience violence should receive post-violence care). 

* Contextual interventions are those that are part of an OU’s DREAMS core package but cannot be linked to an individual AGYW (i.e., community mobilization). Note that these interventions should be included in your layering table but are not tracked as part of the AGYW_PREV indicator as, by definition, they are not linked to individual AGYW.  

Only services provided by PEPFAR count under AGYW_PREV. However, if PEPFAR implementing partners are making active referrals to a service provided by a non-PEPFAR entity, the active referral may be counted as a DREAMS service under AGYW_PREV. If this is the case, your OU-specific Layering Table should specify this (e.g., “facilitating access to government education subsidies” instead of just “education subsidies”).  

DREAMS programs are expected to reach 9-14-year-olds with approved primary prevention of HIV & sexual violence interventions. These interventions should be part of the primary package of interventions for 9-14-year-old active DREAMS beneficiaries and should count towards an active DREAMS beneficiary’s layering status once the service is completed. Completion of the approved primary prevention intervention can also be reported under OVC_SERV in addition to AGYW_PREV (see OVC_SERV guidance). As AGYW_PREV does not include the 5-9 age band, nine-year-olds will not be included in the indicator numerator. Teams should use the AGYW_PREV narrative to report the number of nine- year-olds that are active DREAMS beneficiaries within the reporting period. 

Approved primary prevention of sexual violence and HIV interventions are as follows: Families Matter Program, Sinovuyo Teen, Coaching Boys into Men, IMpower, and Stepping Stones. Countries are strongly encouraged to implement one of these five pre-approved curricula. All other curricula used for 9-14 primary prevention must be approved by S/GAC and the relevant agency HQ and must include the three S/GAC evidence-informed modules on healthy and unhealthy relationships, healthy choices about sex, and understanding non- consensual sex. 

_**Counting Service and Package Completion:**_

Services/interventions should only be counted towards primary package completion if the AGYW has completed that particular service/intervention. Countries should define **service/intervention completion** as part of their country-specific DREAMS Layering Table. Completion definitions should be based on normative guidance and instructions from program developers where available (e.g., country may count a multi-session intervention as complete after beneficiary has attended 80% of the sessions if that is what the instructions from the program developer indicate as completion). Do not count an intervention towards primary/secondary package completion for an individual AGYW until it has been completed per the country’s service completion definition. Please note that “primary package completion” as tracked in AGYW_PREV and “DREAMS program completion” as defined in the [DREAMS Program Completion and Saturation Document](https://www.pepfar.net/Project-Pages/collab-49/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2FProject%2DPages%2Fcollab%2D49%2FShared%20Documents%2FTools%20and%20Guiding%20Documents&FolderCTID=0x012000C4AC9B35DC4AB84FAEEF47AE703A28CE005A5FF8894BD59545A0DF13B2A173C82E&View=%7B72FAEE27%2DA309%2D47AB%2DB14A%2DADEC1D290F18%7D) are not the same thing. **DREAMS program completion** requires that an individual AGYW has completed both the primary package for her age group, as well as all secondary interventions that are appropriate based on her needs. 

An AGYW must have completed at least one service in the past 6 months at Q2 or the past 12 months at Q4 to be counted in any of the following disaggregates: completed the fully primary package and no additional services, completed the primary package and at least one additional service, or completed at least one service but not the full primary package. At Q2 and Q4 reporting, AGYW should be reported under the disaggregate that reflects the snapshot of her current layering status since beginning the DREAMS program. For example, if an AGYW completed her last service in the primary package in the last 6 months (at Q2) or 12 months (at Q4) then she may be counted in the corresponding numerator disaggregate for the current time period, even if she enrolled and began receiving services in DREAMS beginning in a previous year or reporting period. For AGYW reported in the disaggregate of completed at least one service but not the fully primary package, any DREAMS service (from the primary or secondary package) may be counted. 

An AGYW that is enrolled and has started a DREAMS service but has not yet completed it as of the end of the reporting period is still considered an active DREAMS beneficiary (see above). She would be reported in the corresponding disaggregate. If an AGYW has already completed a DREAMS service/intervention while in DREAMS, she should be reported under one the layering disaggregates indicating service completion. For example, if an AGYW has completed HTS but is in process of completing a multi-session prevention curriculum at Q2 (and has not yet completed the primary package), she should be counted in the “completed at least one DREAMS service but not the full primary package” disaggregate. 

_**Using AGYW_PREV Results to Ensure Programmatic Layering:**_ 

The focus of this indicator is to track the layering of the country-specific DREAMS primary package of services/interventions, rather than tracking individual services/interventions themselves. Specific services received by AGYW will continue to be counted under PP_PREV, OVC_SERV, HTS_TST, PrEP_NEW, PREP_CURR, PMTCT_STAT,GEND_GBV, KP_PREV, etc. as appropriate. Furthermore, AGYW enrolled in DREAMS and receiving DREAMS services should be counted under this indicator regardless of the budget code(s) funding the services that they received. For example, if an AGYW is enrolled in DREAMS and receives HIV testing, education support, and PrEP in the reporting period, she would be counted under HTS_TST, PrEP_NEW, PREP_CURR, and OVC_SERV if she meets the definition of each respective indicator. She would also be counted under AGYW_PREV under the appropriate layering and time in DREAMS disaggregates to track if she has received the age-appropriate primary package of DREAMS services/interventions. 

AGYW_PREV was not created to measure or show the impact of DREAMS, it was created to monitor fidelity to layering and to assess DREAMS implementation on the ground. DREAMS country teams should review multiple data sources (i.e., ongoing analyses per the [DREAMS Program Completion and Saturation Document](https://www.pepfar.net/Project-Pages/collab-49/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2FProject%2DPages%2Fcollab%2D49%2FShared%20Documents%2FTools%20and%20Guiding%20Documents&FolderCTID=0x012000C4AC9B35DC4AB84FAEEF47AE703A28CE005A5FF8894BD59545A0DF13B2A173C82E&View=%7B72FAEE27%2DA309%2D47AB%2DB14A%2DADEC1D290F18%7D)) along with AGYW_PREV to evaluate overall DREAMS program performance and coverage. 

Results from this indicator will be used to ensure that layering of DREAMS services is happening across agencies and partners within DREAMS districts and will be used to make programmatic decisions to ensure comprehensive, patient-centered prevention programming for AGYW. AGYW_PREV results will help field teams and HQ answer several essential questions related to DREAMS programming, quality, and reach, including: 
1. How many active DREAMS beneficiaries are in the DREAMS program? 
2. Is layering happening as intended for all AGYW receiving DREAMS services? Are there specific services/interventions that are not reaching AGYW as intended? Are there specific SNUs where layering is stronger or weaker? Are there specific age bands where layering is stronger or weaker? 
3. How does layering change over the time a girl is enrolled in DREAMS? 
   1. Have 90% of active DREAMS beneficiaries completed at least the primary package after being in DREAMS for 13+ months? 
4. Where are active DREAMS beneficiaries along the DREAMS program completion continuum?","**This indicator should be reported only in SNUs where DREAMS-funded activities are occurring in the 15 DREAMS countries** (this includes countries previously referred to as DREAMS-like countries). 

_**This indicator will be inputted in DATIM by the USG team, not individual IPs since this indicator involves data from multiple implementing partners over time.**_ It is recommended that one coordinating partner track layering data within an OU; however, since layering occurs between multiple implementing partners and across time and mechanisms the _**USG team (DREAMS coordinator or DREAMS POC(s)) is best placed to input the data for AGYW_PREV.**_ 

Data collection requires reliable tracking systems that are designed to count the number of one-on-one encounters or participation in group interventions and that reduce double- counting of individuals in a reporting period. A unique identifier should be assigned to AGYW enrolled in DREAMS to track individual-level completion of DREAMS services across partners providing DREAMS services, where applicable. Data should be collected at every encounter/point of service and aggregated in time for PEPFAR reporting cycles. 

Examples of successful DREAMS layering data collection include the use of unique IDs, DREAMS passports or ID cards, and DHIS2 databases. It is a best practice to have one implementing partner that is responsible for the coordination of layering data systems; this partner then works across agencies and partners to ensure that all DREAMS services/interventions available to AGYW are captured within the system. Since layering occurs across partners, agencies, and over time, this indicator will be inputted by USG personnel (e.g., DREAMS coordinator or interagency DREAMS POCs). ","Data should be reviewed regularly for the purposes of program management, to monitor progress of layering, and to identify and correct any data quality issues. Potential data quality issues for AGYW_PREV:

Results should reflect a snapshot of each AGYW’s layering status since they initially became a DREAMS beneficiary until the end of the Q4 reporting period.

    * Indicates the visualized presence of aceto-white lesion on the cervix following the application of acetic acid.
    * In practice, women with a positive result are further differentiated into ‘eligible for cryotherapy’ and ‘ineligible for cryotherapy’, based on the size and location of the lesion.
    * Women with fulminating masses or other indication of suspected cervical cancer are not counted under this disaggregate.

* Suspected Cancer
    * Indicates the visualized presence of a fulminating mass, or other clinical indicator suspicious for invasive cervical cancer.

In practice, women with a VIA screening (or triage) test result of “positive” or “suspected cancer” are both considered **screen-positive** (or triage-positive); however, for the purposes of monitoring, screen-positive results are separated into precancerous lesions (“positive” disaggregate) and suspected cancer (“suspected cancer” disaggregate) because the care pathways for each are different. Precancerous lesions may be treated immediately with outpatient procedures, whereas suspected cancer requires further evaluation (colposcopy, biopsy, diagnosis) before treatment options can be considered. Clinical definitions can be found in Comprehensive cervical cancer control: a guide to essential practice [WHO, 2014].

To ensure people living with HIV receive the care and treatment required to live healthy, productive lives, and to reduce the chance of transmitting HIV, it is critical that they know their status. In many countries, targeting testing and counselling at locations and populations with the highest HIV burden will be the most efficient way to reach people living with HIV and ensure they are aware of their status. This indicator captures the efficacy and coverage of HIV testing interventions.

This indicator is harmonized with GAM indicator “[People living with HIV who know their HIV status.](http://www.indicatorregistry.org/indicator/people-living-hiv-who-know-their-status)”
","There are multiple methods to estimate the number of people living with HIV who know their status.
* Case-based surveillance: In countries with well-functioning HIV reporting systems, the number of people diagnosed can be estimated from national case-based data. The number of deaths among PLHIV must be subtracted from the cumulative number diagnosed to calculate the number of people living with HIV who know their status.
* Survey-based reporting:
 * Certain population-based surveys include questions about known HV status. Although this information may be subject to under-reporting bias, when combined with survey-related HIV testing it can provide an estimate of known status among survey respondents.
 * Many population-based surveys include questions on HIV testing history. These questions can provide a range for the proportion of PLHIV with known status. The percentage of people living with HIV in the survey who have been tested in the past 12 months and received the results provides the upper range of known status (there will be a small proportion equal to the annual incidence rate – less than 2% in most cases – of people who might have converted in the 12 months after being tested). The percentage of people living with HIV in the survey who have ever been tested and received the results provides the lower range of known status.
  * When using survey-based methods, note that:
   * Household surveys are often restricted to respondents of reproductive age (15– 49), and so may not be representative of people living with HIV <15 years and >49 years.

It can be used to better understand PEPFAR’s investments in Strategic information and to support a broader understanding of data quality challenges for other indicators. Timely access to up-to-date patient information plays a vital role in the provision of effective clinical care by health professionals. Diagnosis and treatment can be improved if health professionals have easy access to accurate and comprehensive medical records of patients.,"**Definition of an Electronic Medical Record (EMR):**

An EMR is a longitudinal electronic record of an individual patient's health information that can assist health professionals with decision-making and treatment. Data found in a record may include patient demographics, past medical history, vital signs, examination and progress notes, medications, allergies, immunizations, laboratory test results, other test results. It can also support the collection of data for other uses such as quality management, public health disease surveillance and reporting. EMR can include real-time point-of-care data entry as well as retrospective data entry. An EMR is a digital version of a paper chart that contains key information in a patient’s medical history from one service delivery point or site.

The implementing partner should indicate whether the PEPFAR-supported service delivery areas have implemented and are actively using an electronic medical record system to assist clinical service provision or patient/program monitoring and reporting. Specifically, for PEPFAR reporting a minimum of 6 months of retrospective data should be included in the EMR. (For example, an ART EMR set up in September 2018 to contain at least 6 months of retrospective data (current patients that have been enrolled on ART) could be counted in the reporting at FY18 APR.

**Individual service delivery area/point EMR versus Integrated Health EMR:**

EMRs are typically for all health areas, but PEPFAR is interested in better understanding whether EMRs are available for the service delivery areas where PEPFAR focuses its work. If a service delivery area is incorporated in a larger integrated health EMR, then it should be included this indicator. If two or more service areas are in an integrated EMR, both areas should be included in this indicator. A site service delivery area should be reported under this indicator if the EMR is on site (i.e., server and computer entry screen or there is a central server at a hub facility, that includes all data from all the “spokes” for that facility’s catchment area. As long as the data for patient management and reporting comes from the EMR system as one source.

**For example**, if services are integrated, for example EID service delivery is integrated into treatment services, then as long as EID data is captured in the treatment services EMR (or a separate EMR for EID is available within these services), then the EMR could be counted under both the treatment and EID service delivery areas.

**Registries:**
Some sites maintain types of e-Registers (which might provide basic functionality like reporting, default tracing, etc.). However, _**if these e-Registers do not capture longitudinal clinical information, they should not be included in this indicator.**_","If a site does not report for a specific service delivery area (e.g., the site is not a PEPFAR- supported ART site reporting TX_CURR), then it should not be included as having an EMR in that service delivery area (e.g., EMR for C&T services – N/A should be selected in this case).",N/A.

It captures information about whether FP integration is occurring at various HIV service delivery points within PEPFAR supported sites. Many PEPFAR sites will have numerous service delivery points within each site. For example, if one hospital receives PEPFAR support for both the HIV treatment department AND the ANC department, then the FPINT_SITE total for that one site is 2 service delivery points. 

This indicator will enable PEPFAR stakeholders to: 
* Gain a basic, but essential, understanding of whether FP services are being integrated in PEPFAR-supported service delivery points. 
* Identify gaps, including service contexts, countries, or regions with low levels of HIV/FP integration. 

Inherent within this indicator is the principle that integrated HIV/FP program activities must respect a client’s right to make informed decisions about his or her reproductive life. This means that clients should have access to an appropriate and comprehensive range of contraceptive options; and/or to safer conception/pregnancy counseling depending upon their fertility desire and intentions. Judgments and personal opinions are not appropriate in a clinic setting. 

This indicator will be used to monitor coverage of HIV/FP integration at a global level. **Therefore, detailed information on completion of referrals, FP service uptake, types of contraceptive methods offered on site, and other critical components of integrated programs will not be captured through this indicator but should be maintained at the site or programmatic level.**","**Definition: Voluntary Family Planning Service**

Provision: To be considered as a PEPFAR-supported service delivery point that directly provides fully integrated voluntary FP services, all 3 criteria below must be met. If a service delivery point provides fewer than 3 of the services noted below, it should not be counted under this indicator. 

The PEPFAR-supported HIV service delivery point must provide for all relevant clients, including partners in HIV discordant couples (as documented by standard operating procedures, guidelines, protocols, manuals and/or intake documents, etc.): 
1. Assessment of voluntary FP needs through routinescreening; 
2. Provision of voluntary FP counseling (including safe pregnancy counseling forthose wishing to become pregnant, or those who arepregnant); 
3. Provision or referral of a broad range of modern contraceptive methods, inaccordance with the National FP policy guidelines, for clients who voluntarily wish to delay or prevent pregnancy. It is very much preferred for methods to be available onsite.If referrals are given, they must include detailed information (e.g., facility location, hours of operation, etc.) about where methods can be accessed. 

_Assess Voluntary Family Planning Needs Through Screening (Number 1 above):_ In assessing FP needs, all clients as part of their routine care visit should be asked about their FP needs and practices. Depending upon the individual client and his or her needs, these can include: reproductive goals; prior pregnancies; living and family situation; FP knowledge; previously used FP methods and satisfaction with use; and any FP-related concerns. These needs should be assessed without expressing any personal biases about a client’s preference. 

_Provide Voluntary Family Planning Counseling (including Safe Pregnancy Counseling) (Number 2 above):_ Quality voluntary FP counseling should cover a wide range of topics that are client and context specific, and that include both safe pregnancy counseling for individuals who wish to become pregnant as well as contraception for individuals who wish to avoid, space or delay pregnancy. “FP counseling” is not the same as """"FP education"""". Depending upon the type of FP services that are offered at PEPFAR supported site; health providers or community mobilizers may provide EDUCATION and/or COUNSELING on FP. 

Education activities may include distribution of printed materials, group health education and community outreach efforts among other interventions. Education helps to increase general knowledge on the benefits and importance of FP and increase support for FP use, as well as to link women and their partners to other FP services, including contraceptive method provision. 

FP counseling is an interpersonal communication between the health provider and client where topics specific to the clients’ needs are discussed to help them determine if they want to use FP and if so; to help them choose and use the FP method of their choice. HIV service providers or all levels can be trained and supported to develop or improve their skills at FP counseling. A wide array of FP counseling materials exist that can be used in PEPFAR settings; including national FP flipcharts, counseling cards and informational handouts. 

_Provision or Referral of a Broad Range of Modern Contraceptive Methods (Number 3 above):_ Per U.S. Government legislation, and in line with national FP policies, a broad range of methods should be provided to clients, allowing them to choose the method most appropriate for them, either directly or through referral. For an SDP to be counted towards this indicator, at least three modern contraceptive methods should be available either on site or through referral. Emergency contraception is an important FP method that should be available in all HIV settings as part of FP and gender-based violence (GBV) services. Information on modern contraceptive methods can be found in the references listed at the end of this sheet. All referrals should include detailed information about where methods can be accessed (e.g., facility location, operating hours, etc.). 

**Special Considerations:** 

USG-supported FP and HIV/AIDS programs must adhere to the following principles: 
* People living with HIV (PLHIV) and their partners should be provided with information on and be able to exercise voluntary choices about their health, including their reproductive health. 
* The USG, including PEPFAR, supports a person‘s right to choose, as a matter of principle, the number, timing, and spacing of their children, as well as use of FP methods, regardless of HIV/AIDS status. 
* FP use should always be a choice, made freely and voluntarily, independent of the person‘s HIV status. 
* The decision to use or not to use FP should be free of any discrimination, judgment, stigma, coercion, duress, or deceit and informed by accurate, comprehensible information and access to a variety of methods. 
* Access to and provision of health services, including antiretroviral treatment, for PLHIV should never be conditioned on that person's choice to accept or reject any other service, such as family planning (other than what may be necessary to ensure the safe use of antiretroviral treatment and other drug interactions). 
* PLHIV who wish to have children should have access to safe and non-judgmental pregnancy counseling services.","FPINT_SITE counts the number of individual service delivery points (SDP) at a site with integrated FP services. It does not count the number of sites that integrate FP services. However, the number of sites can be extrapolated from the SDP data. See the definitions for SDP included above. 

Denominator is greater than or equal to the Numerator: The total number of PEPFAR- supported service delivery points (the denominator) must be greater than or equal to the total number of PEPFAR-supported service delivery points that have integrated Family Planning (the numerator).

NOTE: This indicator DOES NOT include GBV Prevention activities or non- clinical community-based GBV response (e.g., shelter programs, case management). 

This indicator will enable PEPFAR to: 
* To determine the number of individuals that are suffering from GBV and reporting to clinical partners. 
* To assess whether post-GBV clinical services are being used. 
* Gain an understanding of the uptake of post-GBV clinical services offered across PEPFAR countries. 
* Provide important information to key stakeholders about PEPFAR programs that mitigate women and girls’ and other marginalized populations’ vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. 
* Support efforts to assess the impact of post-GBV clinical services by correlating the reach (i.e., number of people served) of these services over time with outcomes related to GBV (and HIV/AIDS), as described through other data collection efforts such as survey data (DHS/PHIA/VACS). 
* Identify programmatic gaps by analyzing the number and ages of people receiving services, as well as the reach of services in particular geographic areas.","Data sources are standard program monitoring tools, such as forms, log books, spreadsheets and databases that national programs and /or partners develop or already use. 

Data should be collected continuously at the point of service delivery (i.e., ANC, PMTCT, ART, etc.) and aggregated in time for PEPFAR reporting cycles. 

The indicator can be generated by counting the number of persons receiving post-GBV clinical care, disaggregated by the age group and sex of the client receiving the service, as well as the type of service (sexual violence or emotional/physical violence) and PEP provision (see below for disaggregation information). 

To adequately capture the provision of these services, logs and monitoring forms will need to be used wherever the services are offered. These forms will need to track both the outcome of the initial assessment and the provision of referrals or services. For PEP specifically, registries should collect both the administration of the PEP as well as its completion and the patient’s adherence. 

**Special considerations:** As outlined in the Program Guide for Integrating GBV Prevention and Response in PEPFAR Programs all programs seeking to address GBV must first and foremost protect the dignity, rights, and well-being of those at risk for, and survivors of, GBV. There are four fundamental principles for integrating a GBV response into existing programs and specific actions for putting these principles into practice. These principles are as follows: 
* Do no harm 
* Privacy, confidentiality, and informed consent 
* Meaningful engagement of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and GBV survivors 
* Accountability and M&E","Numerator ≥ subtotal of each of the disaggregation: The number of people receiving post- GBV clinical care should be greater or equal to the sum of each individual disaggregate group.

**Sexual violence (post-rape care):** Although guidelines for post-rape care will vary from country to country, in addition to treatment of serious or life-threatening medical issues (e.g., lacerations, broken bones) and the necessary forensic interviews and examinations, the minimum package of post-rape care services should always begin with an assessment of the client’s specific needs. The following represents the Minimum Package for post-rape care services that must be in place to count under this indicator:

* Provision of Clinical Services: (all of the following must be in place, including relevant commodities, and ability to count individuals—independent of whether individuals use the specific service); 
* Rapid HIV testing with referral to care and treatment as appropriate; 
* Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV -- if person reached within the first 72 hours; 
* STI screening/testing and treatment; 
* Emergency contraception, if person is reached in the first 120 hours. PEPFAR funds cannot be used to procure EC. EC is legal in all PEPFAR countries except Honduras, so should be available in all countries except for Honduras; 
* Counseling (other than counseling for testing, PEP, STI and EC)     

**Physical and/or emotional violence (other Post-GBV care):** GBV can take many forms and includes physical and emotional violence. **The following services should be available for persons who have experienced GBV that is not sexual. If a client experiences both sexual and physical and/or emotional violence, the client should be counted under the sexual violence disaggregate-only. However, the client should receive the appropriate services as defined under both packages.** Services should always begin with an assessment of the client’s specific needs and include, as appropriate.

* Provision of Clinical Services: (all the following must be in place and available to count persons—independent of whether people use the specific service)

* Rapid HIV testing with referral to care and treatment as appropriate (Please note that individuals should also be counted under the MER HIV testing and counseling indicator (i.e., # of individuals who received HIV testing and counseling services and received their results).

* STI screening/testing and treatment

* Counseling (other than for HIV counseling and testing)

**For both Sexual violence and Physical and/or emotional violence:** These cannot be counted for the indicator alone, however where applicable should be offered:

* Longer-term psycho-social support (e.g., peer support groups)

* Legal counsel

* Police

* Child protection services

* Economic empowerment

**Number of People Receiving Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) Services Description:** PEP service provision should only be counted under this indicator if the individual receives PEP treatment (i.e., drugs) in accordance with international and/or national protocols, guidelines, etc., and if the individual **completes** the full course of treatment. If an individual is provided with PEP, completes the full course of treatment (and meets the other criteria detailed within this indicator reference sheet) the individual should be counted under this GBV care indicator. The individual should not be additionally counted under other MER treatment indicators (e.g., # of individuals new on ART; # of individuals ever on ART, etc.) PEP is intended to prevent HIV infection, while other MER treatment indicators monitor ARV provision to those who are HIV positive.

Addressing density and distribution of HRH is important in increasing access to HIV services where they are needed.

In many PEPFAR countries, there are overall shortages of HRH, particularly in rural and remote areas, leading to insufficient numbers of health workers according to internationally recommended levels (2.3 doctors, nurses, midwives/1,000 population). There are also countries where there is large overproduction of health workers, with medical unemployment in urban areas, and at the same time with shortages in rural areas.

Furthermore, different types of health workers receive different types and amounts of support that may vary by geographic location, cadre, workload, and other factors.
Understanding the ways in which different cadres are supported is important for mobilizing differential models of service delivery under different circumstances.

This indicator measures the number of PEPFAR-supported health workers who contribute to providing HIV services at facility and community sites. It allows us to track our level of support and continuously calibrate it based on impact. It also allows us, over time, to measure the transition from PEPFAR support to host country support.
","Data on total numbers of positions supported should be tracked by implementing partner’s record-keeping systems, for example, personnel databases, human resources records, and financial records that show salary or stipend payments, including information on non- monetary support to volunteers. Leverage the same records and systems partners already use to report dollar amounts for work plans and financial reporting, to identify PEPFAR support of HRH. 

For non-monetary supported personnel, partners should cross-reference expense reports and registers against the cadre types who received the corresponding non-monetary benefits. For example, receipts showing transportation allowances were provided to attend meetings could be cross-referenced with the attendance listed in the minutes for community lay workers. 

Facility and community workers are reported by IM, Site ID, facility and community site affiliation, and cadre type. All PEPFAR-supported workers at the facility and community should be reported. 

How to document: 
1. Identify all facility and community sites where you work. 
2. Identify and count the number of health workers (individuals) you support at each site. 
3. Group these health workers into their most appropriate, mutually exclusive cadre (doctor, nurse, lay counselor, laboratory cadres, pharmacy cadres, etc.). 
4. List the total number of workers by each cadre under the “total # of de-duplicated staff by cadre” column. This numerator is entered separately in DATIM, separate from the disaggregates described below. 
5. List all types of monetary and non-monetary support that were provided to health workers at any of those sites in the current fiscal year (as incentive or compensation for time spent on HIV services at those sites). 
6. It is possible for one worker to receive more than one type of support. In such cases individual staff person can be listed under more than one type of support. It is possible for the disaggregates to exceed the numerator for each cadre. However, note that the entries under “total # of de-duplicated staff by cadre” column should be the actual number of workers supported by PEPFAR. 
7. Salary support includes base salary. 
8. Stipend includes any amount paid that is above the standard base salary, allowances, and financial benefits such as health insurance, social security benefits, fringe benefits, etc. For example, a health worker that works out of standard business hours such as a weekend, and PEPFAR pays for weekend hours only. 
9. Assign those types of support to the health workers identified on your site lists and then create a matrix of supported health workers by cadre and support type: 
10. Non-monetary support should be reported even if you provide only non-monetary support, with no salary or stipend. 
11. Above-site support may include Ministry of Health or other government staff who work at the district or provincial level, or at the national level, including Ministry of Health office, National Reference Laboratories, or at national research centers not otherwise providing HIV services directly to beneficiaries.","Sites reporting on HRH_CURR should be reporting DSD results for the indicators that the HRH are supporting.

",NA,,None,Above-Site,Annually,It is widely acknowledged that the lack of trained health workers is a major barrier to scaling up health services. The lack of a sufficient workforce in countries presents a serious challenge to every area of health. The data will tell us the number of new health workers who are available to enter the health workforce each year as a result of PEPFAR support.,"Training under this indicator is defined as “pre-service” training – the training of “new” health workers (see definition below). Training generally occurs prior to the individual entering the health workforce in his or her new position (with the exception of certain training that may occur on-the job but that prepares health workers to function as a new cadre or with an expanded scope of practice in the health system). A health worker who advances to a higher cadre (e.g., a clinical assistant who completes training to become a clinical officer) shall be counted as a “new” health worker for the purposes of this indicator. The HRH goal is to expand the number of workers in the workforce and increase access to care through the advancement of current workers to higher level cadres through additional training and education. 

Pre-service training institutions are university-based or affiliated schools of medicine, nursing, public health, social work, laboratory science, pharmacy, and other health-related fields. Non-professional or paraprofessional training would be any accredited and nationally recognized pre-service program that is a requirement for this cadre’s entry into the workforce. 

“In-service” and “continuing education” training should not be included in the count for this indicator but continue to be encouraged. These types of training may be captured by other indicators within program areas (e.g., supply chain). 

In order to count, the duration of training must meet or exceed a minimum of 6 months. For example, community health workers who receive a 3-month training course cannot be counted here. The training duration may be a combination of classroom and practical field time to arrive at six months. 

A pre-service training program must be nationally accredited, or at the minimum meet national and international standards. The program must also have specific learning objectives, a course curriculum, expected knowledge, skills, and competencies to be gained by participants, as well as documented minimum requirements for course completion. The duration and intensity of training will vary by cadre; however, all training programs should have at a minimum the criteria listed above. 

Individuals may be in training over many reporting periods; however, only participants who have successfully completed their training should be counted. 

Successful completion of training may be documented by diploma, certificate or other evidence of completion of the program and subsequent eligibility to enter service. 

Individuals not meeting these documented requirements should not be counted in this indicator. 

“Health workers” refers to individuals involved in safeguarding and contributing to the prevention, promotion and protection of the health of the population (both professional and auxiliary-professionals). The categories below describe the different types of health workers to be considered under this indicator. This is not an exhaustive list of all health workers and position titles may vary from country to country. For the purposes of this indicator, health workers may include the following but is not limited to: 
* Clinical professionals, including doctors, nurses, midwives, laboratory scientists, pharmacists, medical technologists, and psychologists. They usually have a tertiary education and most countries have a formal method of certifying their qualifications. 
* Clinical officers, medical and nursing assistants, lab and pharmacy technicians, auxiliary nurses, auxiliary midwives, T&C counselors. They should have completed a diploma or certificate program according to a standardized or accredited curriculum and support or substitute for university-trained professionals. 
* Workers in a health ministry, hospital and facility administrators, human resource managers, monitoring and evaluation advisors, epidemiologists and other professional staff critical to health service delivery and program support. 
* Social service workers including social workers, child and youth development workers, social welfare assistants. 

PEPFAR support includes funding in the areas of curriculum development, teacher training and support, tuition/scholarships, infrastructure, materials/equipment, and practica/internships. For example, full or partial support of student tuition or scholarships, teacher salaries, and expansion/refurbishment of pre-service training facilities could all count under this indicator depending on the investment.

This includes staff engaged in community work, but who are supported and based out of a PEPFAR supported facility. This includes but is not limited to Community Health Workers (CHWs) engaged in outreach, ARV delivery, or working as Linkage Officers, Peer Navigators, or Adherence Group coordinators.

This is NOT a cumulative total, but a one-time count undertaken during the final quarter. Only filled staff positions at respective facility should be counted.
For this indicator, a “PEPFAR supported site” should include any facility site in the PEPFAR geographic organizational hierarchy list in DATIM, which also reported any site-level programmatic target or result during the same reporting period. Omit facilities which were previously supported by PEPFAR but were not assigned any targets nor reported any results for any program area during the same reporting period. Include all health care workers irrespective of whether any or all are receiving PEPFAR support (this is captured in HRH_CURR). We do NOT need any workers reported at the community level for this indicator; workers supported by the government or other organizations, but not based out of a PEPFAR supported facility should not be reported.

HIV/AIDS has placed significant demands on the already constrained health workforce in many low-income countries. The rapid scale-up of ART is placing additional demands on the health workforce.

In the majority of PEPFAR countries, there are overall shortages of HRH, particularly in rural and remote areas, leading to insufficient numbers of health workers according to internationally recommended levels (2.3 doctors, nurses, midwives/1,000 population). Many countries experience HRH shortages and/or imbalances by population densities (e.g., HRH shortages in rural areas) that are not related to population health needs, including HIV epidemiology. Addressing density, distribution, and overall utilization of HRH is important in increasing access to HIV services.

This indicator allows PEPFAR to analyze the availability of staff to provide HIV services at PEPFAR supported facilities. Data should be reviewed against site target achievement and investment. The first year of data collection will serve as an Integral benchmark for continued analysis.

Teams can also look at this indicator in conjunction with HRH_CURR that captures number of PEPFAR supported workers at PEPFAR-supported sites. This will allow PEPFAR to conduct analysis to determine if the number of PEPFAR-supported staff is appropriate vis- à-vis the number of other staff at the facility providing HIV services.
There is no universal benchmark against which to measure these data and no ideal PEPFAR to non-PEPFAR ratio. However, over time we would hope to see a decrease in the number of PEPFAR-supported staff. As this happens countries should carefully monitor any changes total number of staff working in HIV service delivery at sites and quality of services.
","A “PEPFAR supported site” for the purpose of this indicator includes any facility site in the PEPFAR master facility list in DATIM which also reported any programmatic target or result during the same reporting period.

Report all HRH at those sites who are working in HIV-related activities, regardless of whether they are supported by PEPFAR or not.

PEPFAR team should collect and report on this data during the last quarter of the year. Ideally this data would come from a MoH HRIS/HRID system, or a payroll system from a Ministry of Finance.

Total number of health workers should be reported. Report HRH who are actively working on services or programs related to HIV at the time of data collection, not including staff who have resigned, absconded, are dismissed, are pending hiring, or are on extended leave (e.g., for graduate studies). Unfilled positions or vacancies should not be included.

However, this indicator represents a cascade and the collected disaggregations serve as both numerators and denominators when analyzing the index testing cascade.",None,Facility & Community,Quarterly,"This is the first MER indicator to monitor PEPFAR programming of HIV Index Testing services (often also referred to as Partner Notification Services or contact tracing, etc.).

Index testing, also referred to as partner testing/partner notification services, is an approach whereby the exposed contacts (i.e., sexual partners, biological children and anyone with whom a needle was shared) of an HIV-positive person (i.e., index client), are elicited and offered HIV testing services. In this context, index testing refers to any HIV testing of the contacts of an index client (i.e., a person known to be HIV positive). _**Only the following persons count as contacts: current or past sexual partner(s), biological children/parents (if index case is a child) or anyone with whom a needle was shared.**_ Biological children reported under HTS_INDEX should only include children of an HIV- positive mother. Children of male-index clients (fathers) should only be included when the biological mother is HIV-positive, she is deceased, or her HIV status is not known or not documented. Conversely, if the index client is the child, his/her mother should be tested, and if the mother is HIV-positive or deceased, the father should be tested as well. In addition, all biologic siblings of the index child should be tested. In this way, provision of index testing services is non-directional, whereby we are trying to follow transmission of the disease. Every newly diagnosed individual becomes a subsequent index client from whom to elicit contacts. Like HTS_TST and HTS_SELF, HTS_INDEX is reported at the facility and community levels.

Testing of persons who have not had exposure through an index client, such as neighbors or family members (e.g., children of HIV-negative mother, grandparents, etc.) not born to the index, should not be reported under HTS_INDEX. Testing of non-contacts should be reported under the modality that best reflects the service delivery point where testing occurred. For example, if HIV testing were conducted in a mobile clinic, unexposed contacts would be reported under the ‘Mobile’ modality of HTS_TST.

All index testing services must meet WHO’s 5C minimum standards, including consent, counseling, confidentiality, correct test results, and connection to HIV prevention (for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals), and HIV care and treatment (often referred to as ‘linkage’, for HIV-positive individuals). The 5 C’s are essential for all HTS, especially in the context of identifying contacts for HIV testing. Additionally, all index clients should be screened for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) per WHO guidelines. An index client should not feel as if they are required to provide contacts in order to receive any services.

HTS_INDEX is separated into several steps (1-4 below) that are aligned with core components of index testing implementation. These steps are part of a cascade of
implementation that begins with an offer of index testing services to the index client and ends in provision of an HIV test (and results) to the contacts named by the index client. This final step 4 (and the age sex disaggregates) will auto-populate into the ‘Index’ modality in HTS_TST for either facility or community.

The steps are:
1. **How many index clients were offered index testing services?** This is the number of index clients (newly diagnosed positive, previously known positives who may or may not be on ART, or clients with unsuppressed viral load) who were offered (e.g., counseled on) index testing services (regardless of whether or not those services were accepted by the index client).
2.  **How many index clients accepted index testing services?** This is the number of index clients who accepted (e.g., agreed to) provision of index testing services by a provider (including, counseling on index testing, elicitation of current or past sexual partners/partner notification, etc.).
3.  **How many contacts did the index client provide?** This is the number of contacts provided by the index client as a result of accepting index testing services. The index client provides the age (<15 or >15) and sex (male or female) of the contact(s). Since the index client ‘self-reports’ these data, the contact’s recorded age and/or sex does not need to be corrected in Step 3 if differing age/sex information is collected in Step 4. As mentioned above, contacts are only sexual partners, biological children/parents, and anyone with whom a needle was shared.
4. **How many contacts were tested for HIV and received their results?** Of those tested and received their results, how many tested positive and negative? This is the number of contacts who were tested for HIV and received their results (positive and negative). The positive and negative disaggregations do not include the contact’s self-reported status; only the actual provision of an HIV test to the contact. However, please note that previous or known positives are also recorded as “known positive” in Step 4. Known positives should not be retested.

Reporting and use of this indicator should not preclude any other data collection or indicators that may be used to monitor implementation, effects, and outcomes related to HIV index testing services. That is, other data may need to be collected and used by the program to ensure efficient and effective implementation of index testing services either at the facility or community level. For example, to have a more accurate denominator for contacts tested, programs may also collect information about the number of contacts reached among the contacts elicited. Furthermore, of those contacts reached, how many agreed to test for HIV? Programs may also wish to disaggregate the numbers of contacts reached and tested by the four different approaches to index testing (e.g., client, dual, contract, and provider) to see which approaches are most effective. Programs could also
track the number of newly diagnosed partners and children linked to HIV treatment.
","The suggested data source is a designated HIV Index Testing Services register or logbook. This will allow easier collection of the data for each step in the index testing cascade shown above (see Steps 1-4 above). Alternatively, existing HTS registers, log books, and reporting forms already in use to capture HTS can be revised to include the steps mentioned above and the updated disaggregation categories. Examples of data collection forms include client intake forms, activity report forms, or health registers such as HTS registers, health information systems, and non-governmental organization records. 

Other important considerations for reporting on high-fidelity index testing services: 
* For a contact to be counted under Step 4, he/she must be tested for HIV and receive their result or be a known positive. That contact could either self-report a known exposure to someone with HIV as their reason for testing, have an index testing referral letter/card/coupon given to them from their HIV-positive partner/family member (client-referral approach), or have been identified during the elicitation process and contacted by a provider. For example, if someone comes to a facility or mobile unit and requests an HIV test and reports a known exposure to someone with HIV as their reason for testing, that person should be counted under HTS_INDEX. Further, that individual’s HIV diagnosis must be confirmed using a nationally validated testing algorithm. For example, an HIV-positive rapid HIV test performed at the community- or facility- level must be confirmed with a second and third (in some contexts) test, which may be performed at the same site or at a different facility. If the confirmatory test is performed at a different facility, then this may require follow-up by implementing partners to confirm the diagnosis before reporting on the Step 4. 
* For children <1, only if serologic tests used for diagnostic purposes should they be reported under HTS_INDEX. Serologic tests for screening infants should be excluded (including tests to look for HIV exposure at age 9 months or another time point). For example, you may use the HTS_INDEX <1 disaggregate to report negative diagnostic results if a serologic-based test is used to confirm the absence of HIV infection in infants <1-year-old who have not breastfed for at least 3 months prior to testing. However, since diagnosis of HIV infection in infants is typically based on virologic, and not serologic tests, the general expectation is not to see results in the “<1” disaggregate of the HTS_INDEX indicator. HIV virologic testing of HIV-exposed infants should be counted under PMTCT_EID. 
* Programs that utilize the ‘dual-referral’ approach (i.e., the provider/counselor sits with an index client and their partner(s) to assist with disclosure and/or partner testing) may want to offer re-testing to the index client to protect his or her safety. In this case, the index client’s test result should NOT be counted again under HTS_INDEX or HTS_TST. Individuals who undergo couples testing (i.e., neither partner knows their status) should be counted under HTS_TST and the appropriate service delivery modality should be indicated (e.g., ANC). 
* The partner elicitation process of index testing is a continuous process. Providers/counselors should follow local SOPs to determine when PLHIV are asked again about any new partners or previous partners that may not have been disclosed by the index client previously. 
* Retesting for verification of HIV positive status before or at antiretroviral (ART) initiation should not be counted under HTS_INDEX. Retesting for verification is primarily conducted as a quality assurance activity to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure those initiated on ART are indeed HIV positive. Therefore, retesting for verification should only be conducted for persons who have received an HIV diagnosis, but have not yet been initiated on ART. 

**Please refer to HTS_TST for information on Data Quality and reporting considerations that would also apply here.** 

**Key Populations:** 

Provision of data (on any of the steps outlined above) specific to key populations (FSW, MSM, Transgender people, PWID, and people in prisons and other closed settings) who were tested and received their results should be included but not disaggregated into a separate ‘KP’ disaggregate. That is, there is no separate Key Population disaggregate requested (unlike HTS_TST). The first priority of data collection and reporting of testing for the index client and their contacts, particularly key populations, must be to do no harm. These data must be managed confidentially to ensure the identities of individuals are protected and to prevent further stigma and discrimination of key populations. Please refer to the KP_PREV and PP_PREV indicator reference sheets for more information on working with KPs.","Data should be reviewed regularly for the purposes of program management, to monitor progress towards achieving targets, and to identify implementation and data quality issues.

In addition, data reported under each step can be compared to the previous step where it makes programmatic sense. Potential scenarios include: (1) Generally speaking, the number of contacts who were tested for HIV (Step 4) should not be greater than the number of contacts provided (Step 3). Note: testing of a contact of an index client, who was not part of a formal index testing elicitation strategy, may be counted under Step 4 if that contact discloses that his/her sexual or needle-sharing partner is a known positive. (2) Additionally, it is possible for the number of contacts provided by the index client (Step 3) to be greater than the number of index clients who accepted index testing services (Step 2). However, if the number of contacts provided (step 3) is lower than the number of index clients accepting services (step 2), then most index clients are naming zero contacts, which may suggest an issue with the elicitation process.

One approach is to identify recent HIV infections, defined as those acquired within approximately the last one year. Incorporation of rapid tests for recent HIV-1 infection into routine HIV testing services will enable the establishment of a surveillance system to quickly detect, monitor, characterize, and intervene on recent infections among newly diagnosed HIV cases. Data collected from a recent infection surveillance system can also be used to fine-tune a country’s programmatic response through prioritized programming and resource allocation.

Recommended use of this indicator is described below. For additional information on recent infection surveillance, please refer to the PEPFAR guidance on recent infection testing, template protocol on establishing recent infection surveillance, TRACE (Tracking with Recency Assays to Control the Epidemic) toolkit and eLearning Hub, and the emerging technology page on pepfarsolutions.org.


* **Surveillance:** Characterization of recent and long-term HIV infections will enable the identification of geographic areas and/or demographic groups that may benefit from intensified prevention and testing activities and may also be used to monitor epidemic trends over time.

* **Public Health Program Response:** Monitoring the number and percentage of recent infections by facility and community can be used to identify areas with ongoing active transmission to quickly target education, prevention, and testing resources to increase case finding, intensify index testing services, and subsequently interrupt disease transmission. Disaggregation by age, sex, modality, and key population type can further identify subpopulations at higher risk to inform program planning and implementation. Changes over time should be monitored to assess program impact.

* **Program Implementation:** The indicator may be used to monitor the rollout of testing for recent infection. A crude estimate of testing coverage may be calculated using: HTS_RECENT by applicable age/sex bands divided by HTS_TST_POS by applicable age/sex bands. Tests for recent infection should be performed as a supplementary test for persons who are diagnosed with HIV-1 through the national HIV testing algorithm. The results of tests for recent infection should be used for surveillance purposes and are not intended to affect clinical management. Results may or may not be returned to patients depending on country context and policies. If results are returned to patients, counseling
messages should be provided to explain the results and emphasize that HIV care and treatment will not differ based on recent infection status.

Please see the diagrams below that describe the HTS_RECENT flow in more detail. Two examples are shown for testing done at the facility/community and testing that involves sending specimens to a laboratory to confirm RTRI recent results.","Data for this indicator are reported at both the facility and community levels. HTS_RECENT should be reported alongside HTS_TST at facilities and communities where tests for recent infection have been incorporated as a supplemental test to the country-approved HIV diagnostic testing algorithm.

Even if the testing algorithm requires facility or community-based providers to refer specimens to a laboratory or hub facility for testing for recent infection, the indicator should be reported under the facility or community testing partner where the specimen was collected. This means that HTS_RECENT should be reported by the clinical service partner (or equivalent) supporting the facility or community where the test for recent infection was performed. However, in limited cases, reporting may need to be done by other partners supporting recent infection surveillance, such as surveillance or laboratory partners. For example, if a facility sends specimens of persons who test recent to a laboratory to perform viral load testing to confirm recent status, then it may make sense for the laboratory to report confirmed results.

Electronic case-based surveillance systems that incorporate test for recent infection results may be used to collect and report data for this indicator. Where those systems do not exist or do not include test for recent infection results, existing HTS registers, log books, and reporting forms that have been modified to incorporate test for recent infection results may be used.
Tools specifically designed for test for recent infection would be another option to collect and report data.

Country guidelines may vary in reference to the time point and setting at which testing for recent infection is conducted. HTS is recommended, but other service delivery points may be considered if the test for recent infection is conducted within a short period of initial HIV diagnosis. Ideally, the test for recent infection should be conducted at the same time as diagnosis. Data for this indicator are collected and reported regardless of whether or not test results have been returned to the patient.

If guidelines specify that viral load testing be conducted alongside the test for recent infection as part of a recent infection testing algorithm (RITA), then these results should be recorded in addition to the rapid test for recent infection (RTRI) results. Because RITA results will take longer than RTRI, do not wait for RITA results to report the RTRI results. Viral load testing should be incorporated at facilities/communities with ready access to viral load testing or sample referral networks but is not required at facilities/communities that do not have this infrastructure in place.

**Key Populations:**

Information on tests for recent infection should be reported by key population (PWID, MSM, TG, FSW, and people in prison or other closed settings) where it is safe to collect this information.

See Appendix A: Key Population Classification Document, to inform identification of key populations at HTS service delivery. Reporting of key population disaggregation should be consistent with what is described under the KP_PREV “How to review for data quality” section on mutual exclusivity of an individual who falls under multiple key population categories (e.g., FSW who injects drugs). In such instances, the individual should only be reported in ONE key population disaggregation category to avoid double-counting.

Note: Both key population-specific and clinical partners should complete these disaggregations, but only if it is safe to maintain these files and report. Age and sex data on key populations receiving tests for recent infection will not be reported. Please refer to the KP_PREV indicator reference sheets for more information on working with key populations. **The first priority of data collection and reporting of HTS_RECENT among key populations must be to do no harm.** These data must be managed confidentially to ensure the identities of individuals are protected and to prevent further stigma and discrimination.","* HTS_TST_POS (≥15 years) ≥ HTS_RECENT: The number of persons age ≥15 years who received HIV testing services and received a positive result should be greater than or equal to the number of persons who tested for recent infection.

*	A long-term result on the RTRI means that the person was like infected more than one year ago. This is the final result and does not require additional testing.

*	The RTRI may produce two other results: invalid and HIV negative. These results should not be reported for this indicator but should be captured in the country’s recent infection surveillance database for monitoring purposes. In the event of an invalid or HIV-negative result, please follow the country’s established procedures for dealing with these results (e.g., retesting, reporting, quality control, etc.).

**Confirmed result through viral load testing**

*	Viral load testing is done to confirm RTRI recent results as part of a recent infection testing algorithm (RITA). Persons who receive viral load testing should be reported as a subset of those reported under RTRI.

HIV self-testing refers to a process in which a person collects his or her own specimen (oral fluid or blood), performs an HIV test, and then interprets the results. This is often done in a private setting, either alone or with a trusted person. HIV self-testing is a **screening test** and requires self-testers with a reactive (preliminary positive) result to receive further testing from a trained provider using a validated national testing algorithm. HIV self-testing approaches range from unassisted self-testing (with limited or no instruction provided) to directly assisted self-testing (where a testing provider demonstrates how to use the self-test kit). Self-test kits can be distributed in various ways (i.e., by providers or outreach workers, over-the-counter, etc.). Secondary distribution of HIV self-test kits may also occur (e.g., to partners of ANC attendees, or clients of FSWs).

This indicator aims to monitor trends in the distribution of HIV self-test kits within a country at the lowest distribution point (i.e., between the distributer and the intended user(s)/recipient). The implementation of HIV self-testing programs should facilitate and enhance access to and uptake of HIV testing services for populations where HIV test uptake is low and undiagnosed HIV infection is high (i.e., men, adolescents/young adults, and key populations).
","The suggested data source is a (newly developed) HIVST (HIV self-test) register or logbook. This will minimize any potential confusion with HTS_TST data collection and reporting since HIV self-testing is only a screening test and should not be reported under HTS_TST which only includes diagnostic testing. If a standalone HIVST register or logbook is not possible, revise existing HTS registers, log books, and reporting forms already in use to include very clear labels to indicate self-testing to prevent information entered in an HTS register from being counted and reported under HTS_TST or HTS_TST_POS.

Note that one individual can receive multiple self-test kits (e.g., one for themselves and one for their partner or partners). **Data for the numerator should be generated by counting the number of individual HIV self-test kits distributed and _NOT_ the number of individuals receiving an HIV self-test kit.** Number of self-test kits distributed should be captured and reported at the lowest distribution point. The lowest distribution point refers to the individual/site giving out self-test kits and capturing data for monitoring purposes. This is to prevent double counting between the various higher supply chain levels.

_**For example,**_ the central warehouse distributes 500 self-test kits to an implementing partner doing outreach for KPs. The implementing partner gives their peer outreach workers a total of 50 self-test kits to give out during an outreach event. The outreach workers return from their event having given out 30 self-test kits. In this scenario, the lowest distribution point would be the outreach workers who are capturing the monitoring data. Therefore, the
number of tests kits distributed would be 30. Each of these lowest distribution counts should be rolled up (aggregated) to create the numerator for this indicator.

The disaggregation by type of self-testing provides information about the proportion of test kits distributed through each model (i.e., directly assisted vs. unassisted self-testing).
Further disaggregation by “number of tests distributed to a person by age/sex” (for both directly assisted and unassisted self-testing) and “test kit distributed for use by” (for unassisted self-testing) can provide information about what subpopulations are receiving HIVST kits and who the test kit is intended for use by (i.e., self, sex partner, other) in the unassisted model. The findings can support national government and PEPFAR programs to assess how efficient different distribution approaches are at reaching target populations. These data may also be useful for projecting programmatic commodities (e.g., self-test kits) and systems needs (e.g., staffing resources). It is important to note that for the purposes of this indicator, it is assumed that the tests distributed to individuals and counted in the directly assisted self-testing model are the used by individuals that received them so the disaggregation for “test kit distributed for use by” is not requested in the directly assisted model. Please refer to the example clarification below for additional details.

_**For example**_, if an 18-year-old female reports to a testing site and receives a one-on-one testing demonstration for herself – the test for herself will be reported as directly assisted and you would provide the age/sex disaggregation data for one test kit distributed in the 15- 19-year-old age band. When she leaves the clinic, she takes two additional test kits along with her: one for her sex partner and one for her friend to use at a later time. The two test kits for her sex partner and friend would be counted as unassisted. For the age/sex breakdown under unassisted, 2 tests would go in the 15-19-year-old female age band because two tests were distributed to the female in that age band. _**The reporting follows the distribution of the test kits and not the age/sex demographics of the end user of the self-test kit.**_ For the “test kit distributed for use by” disaggregate, you would indicate a ‘1’ in the ‘sex partner’ disaggregate for the test she planned to distribute to her sex partner and a ‘1’ in the ‘other’ disaggregate for the test she planned to distribute to her friend.

It is understood that registers and procedures for HIVST are still relatively new in many PEPFAR countries and specific distribution methods (e.g., vending machines) may not always allow for collection of detailed data on self-test kit distribution. As such, the only required disaggregate for this indicator will be for the type of self-testing (i.e., directly- assisted vs. unassisted). In addition, age/sex demographic information for test kits distributed using the directly-assisted self-testing model will also be required as these individuals should have received an in-person HIV test kit demonstration and demographic information should be collected at that time

Note: Although not required, implementing partners should attempt to document and report information about actual use of self-test kits. This includes who used the test kit, the test result from the self-test and linkage to retesting (if result is reactive), particularly when directly assisted HIVST occurs. Methods used may include request the return of the kits or follow up calls to determine outcomes. This information can further inform whether HIVST services are reaching individuals who may be HIV-positive and if those individuals are retesting to confirm their diagnosis.

For more information on HIV self-testing, please refer to the [“WHO Guidelines on HIV Self- Testing and Partner Notification”](https://www.who.int/hiv/pub/vct/hiv-self-testing-guidelines/en/) released in December 2016. To review a repository of
country-specific guidance and polices related to HIV self-testing, please visit the [HIV Self- Testing Research and Policy Hub](www.hivst.org).","Data should be reviewed regularly for the purposes of program management, to monitor progress towards achieving targets, and to identify and correct any data quality issues. For example, the number of test kits distributed should not be greater than the number of test kits a provider allocated during the reporting period. Pay careful attention to the number of HIVST kits distributed at pharmacies and online.

**Implementing partners should review their data to ensure that HTS_SELF is not reported under HTS_TST (or HTS_TST_POS) results.** Furthermore, data should be reviewed to ensure the numerator does not include the number of HIV self-tests performed or used, nor does it reflect a definitive diagnosis (which would be reported under HTS_TST).

The “directly-assisted” disaggregate should be reviewed to see if additional information was collected related to: 1) test result (negative or reactive) and 2) linkage for repeat testing to confirm a reactive self-test result. While not required for this indicator, this information should be collected by implementing partners as part of routine program monitoring.",Sum results across quarters.,"**Type of self-testing [Required]**

At a minimum, this means the
person was tested for HIV and received their HIV test results
",NA,,None,Facility & Community,Quarterly,"This indicator is intended to monitor trends in the uptake of HTS (regardless of the service delivery modality and population group) within a country.

The disaggregation by test result provides information about the proportion of persons testing HIV positive and the effectiveness of HTS programs in identifying people living with HIV (PLHIV) over time.

Further disaggregations are intended to monitor access to and uptake of HTS by population (age, sex, and test result), HTS setting and service delivery modality. The findings can support national governments and PEPFAR programs to determine the coverage and identify gaps in HTS services. These data may also be useful for projecting programmatic commodities and system needs such as HIV test kits and other staffing resources, although the numerator reflects the number of individuals tested, not the number of tests performed.

Please reference the WHO Consolidated Guidelines on HIV Testing Services for information “relevant to the provision of HTS and…issues and elements for effective delivery of HTS that are common in a variety of settings, contexts and diverse populations”. http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/hiv-testing-services/en/
","Existing HTS registers, log books, and reporting forms already in use to capture HTS can be revised to include the updated disaggregation categories. Examples of data collection forms include client intake forms, activity report forms, or health registers such as HTS registers, health information systems and non-governmental organization records. Data for the numerator should be generated by counting the total number of individuals who received HTS and their test results.

Note: Although several other MER indicators (see below) may report on the HIV status of individuals, actual testing of individuals must be reported under HTS_TST. Thus, any persons who are newly tested as part of the programs linked to the indicators listed below (i.e., PMTCT, TB, VMMC, Prevention services) must be reported under one of the HTS_TST modalities, unless otherwise indicated below.

* PMTCT_STAT (data from PMTCT_STAT auto-populates to HTS_TST PMTCT ANC1-Only modality)

* TB_STAT (data from TB_STAT auto-populates to HTS_TST TB modality)

* VMMC_CIRC (data from VMMC_CIRC auto-populates to HTS_TST VMMC modality)

* HTS_INDEX (data from HTS_INDEX auto-populates to HTS_TST Index modality)

* PrEP_CURR

* PP_PREV

* KP_PREV

* OVC_HIVSTAT

**Importantly, if a site does not report on TB_STAT, VMMC_CIRC, or PMTCT_STAT, any HIV testing conducted in locations related to VMMC, PMTCT or TB should be reported under the ‘Other PITC’ modality of HTS_TST.**

For an individual to be counted under this indicator, that individual’s HIV diagnosis must be confirmed using a nationally validated testing algorithm. For example, an HIV-positive rapid HIV test performed at the community- or facility- level must be confirmed with a second test, which may be performed at the same site or at a different facility. If the confirmatory test is performed at a different facility, then this may entail follow-up by implementing partners to confirm the diagnosis before reporting on this indicator. The implementing partner who first identified and tested the individual should report on HTS_TST under the appropriate modality; however, that implementing partner must ensure that the diagnosis of the individual tested is confirmed. Only a confirmed diagnosis (positive or negative) counts under HTS_TST regardless of the modality used for reporting. Similarly, simply only confirming the diagnosis of an individual who has already been tested (as per the national testing algorithm) does not fulfill the requirements for reporting on HTS_TST regardless of the modality used.

For children <1, only if serologic tests are used for diagnostic purposes should they be reported under HTS_INDEX. Serologic tests for screening infants should be excluded (including tests to look for HIV exposure at age 9 months or another time point). For example, if the partner/program uses serologic-based testing to confirm absence of HIV infection in infants <1-year-old who have not breastfed for at least 3 months prior to testing, you may use the HTS_INDEX <1 disaggregate to report negative diagnostic results for such cases. However, since diagnosis of HIV infection in infants is based on virologic and not serologic tests, the general expectation is not to see results in the “< 1” disaggregate of the HTS_INDEX indicator. HIV virologic testing of HIV-exposed infants should be counted under PMTCT_EID and PMTCT_HEI_POS.

Retesting for verification of HIV positive status before or at antiretroviral (ART) initiation should not be counted under HTS_TST since testing of this individual will have already been counted at the point of the initial diagnosis. Retesting for verification is primarily done as a quality assurance activity to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure those initiated on ART are indeed HIV positive. Therefore, retesting for verification should only be performed for persons who have received an HIV diagnosis but have not yet been initiated on ART. While retesting for verification should not be recorded as HTS_TST or HTS_TST_POS, these data should nevertheless be tracked and rates of discordancy monitored.

**Key Populations (KPs):**

Provision of information (tested, tested positive, tested negative) on KPs (FSW, MSM, Transgender people, PWID, and people in prisons and other closed settings) who were tested and received their results should be reported under the KP disaggregates. _However, the KP disaggregate is NOT an HTS_TST modality._ All KP testing should be reported under the appropriate modality. For example, a community site keeps secure and safe records of all key populations tested at that site. This community site has determined it can report on the KP disaggregate in a safe and confidential way. Of the 100 individuals KPs who were tested and received their results (including confirmation of diagnosis) at this site, the community site reports 100 under the appropriate modality (in this case, VCT) AND reports 100 under the KP disaggregate.

See Appendix A: Key Population Classification Document, to inform identification of key populations at HTS service delivery. However, reporting of key population disaggregation should be consistent with what is described under the KP_PREV “How to review for data quality” section on mutual exclusivity of an individual who falls under multiple key population categories (e.g., FSW who injects drugs). In such instances, the individual should only be reported in ONE key population disaggregation category to avoid double-counting.

Note: Both key population-specific and clinical partners should complete these disaggregations, but only if it is safe to maintain these files and report. Age and sex data on key populations receiving tests for recent infection will not be reported. Please refer to the KP_PREV indicator reference sheets for more information on working with KPs.

**The first priority of data collection and reporting of HTS among key populations must be to do no harm.** These data must be managed confidentially to ensure the identities of individuals are protected and to prevent further stigma and discrimination of key populations.

Note the misalignment of reporting frequency between HTS_TST [quarterly] and KP_PREV [semi-annually] and the differences in the process of de-duplication of individuals (HTS_TST is de-duplicated within the quarter, whereas KP_PREV is de-duplicated within the fiscal year). For example, if a KP is reached and tested more than once within the fiscal year, s/he will only be counted once under KP_PREV but could be counted multiple times under HTS_TST KP disaggregation during same the fiscal year if the KP was tested multiple times in different quarters. However, if a KP is tested multiple times within the same quarter, s/he should be deduplicated (i.e., only be counted once in the quarter). Please be cognizant of such limitations when interpreting KP_PREV, HTS_TST, and HTS_TST_POS cascade data by key populations.

**Data Systems and Tools**

When developing or modifying existing monitoring and evaluation systems and tools to collect and report on this indicator, the following information should be considered (* designates data elements that are required for HTS_TST reporting in DATIM):
1. This indicator counts the number of individuals tested not the number of tests conducted. All efforts should be made to ensure data are collected on individuals tested vs. number of tests conducted through de-duplication. Within HTS registers, collecting data on the following variables should be considered to help in these efforts:
   1. Retesting status: new tester, re-tester (i.e., tested in the last 3 months), retesting to verify an HIV-positive diagnosis before ART initiation
   1. HIV testing services - *HIV test results, date of HIV test, receipt of HIV test results, previously tested during the reporting period
   1. Demographic - Client’s Unique ID, name, *sex, and *age at time of HTS services
   1. Date HIV-positive individual was linked to treatment
   1. Site - *site name and ID, district, region, province, and *service delivery modality
2. Using unique identifiers for individuals is one way to account for retesting and avoid double reporting if electronic systems are available to easily link data through these unique identifiers. Another approach is to record information about prior testing on the HTS client register.
3. For an individual to be counted under HTS_TST, their HIV diagnosis must be confirmed using a nationally validated testing algorithm. For example, an HIV-positive rapid HIV test performed at the community- or facility- level must be confirmed with a second test, which may be performed at the same site or at a different facility. If the confirmatory test is performed at a different facility, then this may entail follow-up by implementing partners to confirm the diagnosis before reporting on this indicator. The implementing partner who first identified and tested the individual should report on HTST_TST under the appropriate modality; however, that implementing partner must ensure that the diagnosis of the individual tested is confirmed. That is, only a confirmed diagnosis (positive or negative) counts under HTS_TST regardless of the modality used for reporting. Similarly, simply only confirming the diagnosis of an individual who has already been tested (as per the national testing algorithm) does not fulfill the requirements for reporting on HTS_TST regardless of the modality used.
4. Note: Retesting for verification of HIV positive status before or at antiretroviral (ART) treatment initiation is only done for persons who have already been diagnosed HIV- positive as per the national HIV testing guidelines. All clients diagnosed HIV-positive should be retested for verification before or at ART initiation with a new specimen and preferably a second operator using the same national HIV testing strategy. Retesting for verification is primarily done as a quality assurance activity to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure those initiated on ART and treatment services are indeed HIV positive. Thus, HIV testing conducted to verify status should not be counted under HTS_TST, since their initial HIV diagnosis will have already been counted at the point of the initial receipt of the HIV diagnosis (as per the national HIV testing guidelines).
5. Patient level Deduplication: adding “has patient been tested in the last 3 months” to the HTS facility and community registers can help implementing partners de-duplicate at the reporting level.","Only one age disaggregation type is used for age/sex/test result received:
The number of individuals newly receiving ART must be disaggregated by age and sex.

In addition to reporting the total number of individuals tested and receiving their test results and the total type of test results received (negative, positive), HTS_TST data should be disaggregated by service delivery modality, and then also by age/sex/test result within each service delivery modality. Service delivery modalities can reflect a reason for testing (index, STI), as well as, the location/place of testing (e.g., inpatient ward, VCT drop-in center). For example, STI and Index in this context refer to a reason a person is seeking or being offered an HIV test i.e., the person suspects he/she may have an STI or the person is a contact of an index client (see modalities below for more details). In either case (STI or index), that person should be reported under either STI or index even if he/she were tested for HIV any other location or setting (inpatient, VCT, drop-in center). That is, reporting the reason for testing as either STI or Index takes precedence over all other modalities. A single person should only be counted once under any given modality.

**Service delivery modalities are defined as:**

**Community-based testing: Applies to any testing done outside of a designated health facility. Within community-based testing, the following disaggregates are available:**
1. **Index:** Importantly, the index modality under HTS_TST will auto-populate from HTS_INDEX (see HTS_INDEX reference sheet for more information). Index testing, also referred to as partner testing/partner notification services, is an approach whereby the exposed contacts (i.e., sexual partners, biological children and anyone with whom a needle was shared) of an HIV-positive person (i.e., index client), are elicited and offered HIV testing services. That is, in this context, Index testing refers to any HIV testing of contacts of an index client (i.e., a known positive). **Only the following persons count as contacts: current or past sexual partner(s), biological children /parents (if index case is child) or anyone with whom a needle was shared. Biological children reported under HTS_INDEX should only include children of an HIV- positive mother and children of male-index clients (fathers) whose biological mother is HIV-positive, deceased, or her HIV status is not known or not documented.** Conversely, if the index client is the child, his/her mother should be tested, and if positive or deceased, the father should be tested as well. In this way, provision of index testing services is non-directional, whereby we are trying to follow transmission of the disease, and every newly identified positive becomes a subsequent index client from whom to elicit contacts. While testing the contacts of an index client may occur in mobile, VCT or other community testing venue, this testing should be reported under HTS_INDEX. That is, if an individual could be reported under both HTS_INDEX and another HTS_TST modality, that individual should only be reported once under HTS_INDEX. Again, the index modality under HTS_TST will auto-populate from HTS_INDEX (see HTS_INDEX reference sheet for more information).
1. **Mobile:** Testing in Mobile ad hoc or temporary testing locations, such as community centers, schools, workplaces, and includes testing in mobile unit such as tents and vans. Testing related to VMMC services is not included here and should be reported under facility based VMMC modality.
1. **VCT (Voluntary Counseling and Testing):** Includes testing conducted in standalone VCT center that exists outside of a designated health facility (e.g., drop-in-center, wellness clinic where HTS services are provided, testing sites aimed at key populations, etc.).
1. **Other community platforms:** Includes all community-based modalities not captured above (e.g., ad hoc testing campaign that does not satisfy the mobile testing definition, social network testing amongst high risk populations, and community-based OVC testing) should be entered under this modality.

**Facility-based testing: Applies to any testing occurring inside a designated health facility. Within the facility-based testing, the following disaggregates are available:**

5.	**Index:** Importantly, the index modality under HTS_TST will auto-populate from HTS_INDEX (see HTS_INDEX reference sheet for more information). Index testing, also referred to as partner testing/partner notification services, is an approach whereby the exposed contacts (i.e., sexual partners, biological children and anyone with whom a needle was shared) of an HIV-positive person (i.e., index client), are elicited and offered HIV testing services. That is, in this context, Index testing refers to any HIV testing of contacts of an index client (i.e., a known positive). Only the following persons count as contacts: current or past sexual partner(s), biological children /parents (if index case is child) or anyone with whom a needle was shared. Biological children reported under HTS_INDEX should only include children of an HIV-positive mother and children of male-index clients (fathers) whose biological mother is HIV-positive, deceased, or her HIV status is not known or not documented. Conversely, if the index client is the child, his/her mother should be tested, and if positive or deceased, the father should be tested as well. In this way, provision of index testing services is non-directional, whereby we are trying to follow transmission of the disease, and every newly identified positive becomes a subsequent index client from whom to elicit contacts. While testing the contacts of an index client may occur in mobile, VCT or other community testing venue, this testing should be reported under HTS_INDEX. That is, if an individual could be reported under both HTS_INDEX and another HTS_TST modality, that individual should only be reported once under HTS_INDEX. Again, the index modality under HTS_TST will auto-populate from HTS_INDEX (see HTS_INDEX reference sheet for more information).
1.	Provider Initiated Counseling and Testing (PITC):
    1.	**Emergency:** Includes persons tested or seen in a designated emergency department or ward for the immediate care and treatment of an unforeseen illness or injury.
    1.	**Inpatient:** Includes PITC occurring among those patients admitted in the inpatient and surgery wards.
    1.	**Malnutrition:** Clinics and inpatient wards predominately dedicated to the treatment of malnourished children. While this service delivery modality may be
part of either inpatient or outpatient services, if an individual could be reported under both malnutrition and another service delivery modality, report an individual only once and under malnutrition. However, the biological children of female index cases should be classified under the Index testing modality.
    1.	**Pediatric <5 Clinic:** Includes PITC occurring in the pediatric <5 clinic only. This modality refers only to children tested in the <5 clinic. Children tested for any other reason should be counted under the respective modality where their testing occurred. Note that this modality does not include virologic testing, which is reported under PMTCT_EID, nor rapid HIV testing used to identify HIV exposed infants. This modality should also not include children of index cases who should be classified under the Index modality or malnourished children who should be classified under Malnutrition.
    1.	**PMTCT (ANC1 Only):** Pregnant women tested at their 1st antenatal care clinic (ANC) for their current pregnancy (who are also reported under PMTCT_STAT) are reported under this modality. Refer to PMTCT_STAT reference sheet for guidelines on data collection. Individuals counted under PMTCT_STAT who already knew their status should not be reported under HTS_TST.
    1.	**PMTCT (Post ANC1: Pregnancy/L&D/BF):** Includes pregnant or breastfeeding women who receive a test POST ANC1, this includes women who are tested later in pregnancy (>ANC2), during labor & delivery (L&D), and while breastfeeding.
    1.	**STI:** Includes persons seen in a designated STI clinic as well as patients seen in the OPD for STI symptoms. This includes suspect and confirmed STI cases. HIV testing may take place in an STI clinic, an OPD, a co-located VCT or other setting. However, if the reason for the HIV testing is the individual is either a suspect or confirmed STI case, then the test should be reported under the STI modality.
    1.	**TB:** Includes persons referred for HIV testing because they are a confirmed TB case. Refer to TB_STAT for guidelines on data collection for TB. Individuals counted under TB_STAT who already knew their status should not be reported under HTS_TST.
    1.	**Other PITC:** This includes any other provider-initiated testing and counseling that is not captured in one of the other testing modalities listed above. For reporting purposes, this includes testing of patients triaged to other clinics within the OPD that see patients for routine/chronic care (i.e., eye, dental, dermatology, diabetes, etc.). This does not include patients seen in the OPD for emergency care or an STI. Those patients should be classified under the emergency and STI modalities, respectively.
1.	**VMMC:** This modality includes HIV testing for males conducted as part of VMMC programs in both facility and mobile outreach programs. Testing is recommended through the VMMC program, although not mandatory. Refer to VMMC_CIRC for guidelines on data collection for VMMC.
1.	**VCT:** Refers to a clinic specifically intended for HIV testing services that is co-located within a broader health care facility. This data can typically be found in the VCT register. _**This should not include testing of patients referred by providers from other clinical services within the facility (TB, ANC, Inpatient, emergency, etc.). Even though the actual test may be administered in the VCT clinic, report those individuals under the serviced delivery modality from which they were referred.**_
This modality should not include testing of exposed partners and exposed family members of an index case, who should be reported under the Index disaggregate.",,,"Standard definitions of DSD and TA-SDI apply.

_For HTS services, direct service delivery includes:_ ongoing procurement of critical HTS related commodities such as rapid HIV test kits or requisite materials (lancets, capillary tubes), samples and materials for proficiency testing, other HIV diagnostic commodities, or funding for salaries of HIV testing service providers including counselors, laboratory technicians, program managers, and/or community health workers. Staff who are responsible for the completeness and quality of routine patient records (paper or electronic) can be counted here; however, staff who exclusively fulfill MOH and donor reporting requirements cannot be counted.

In addition, MAT can help improve retention for those who are on ART. Therefore, all people who are dependent on opioids should be offered and have access to this service. The implementation of MAT programs should facilitate and enhance access to HIV-specific services for PWID including HIV testing services, linkages to ARV treatment programs, PMTCT for female PWID, and a range of other prevention and harm reduction services.

Implementing partners providing MAT referrals-only should not use this indicator unless it the services being provided meet the KP_MAT_TA requirement outlined in the PEPFAR- support definitions below.

It is important to know how many people are reached in order to monitor how well programs are reaching PWIDs with medication-assisted treatment. This information can be used to plan and make decisions on how well the PWID audience is being reached with medication- assisted treatment. If a small percentage of the intended audience is being reached, then it would be recommended that activities are adjusted to improve reach. If a large percentage of the intended audience is being reached, then headquarters staff would want to take these lessons learned and disseminate them to other countries. The country can use the information to improve upon the quality of the program as well as scale-up successful models.

the indicator “HTS_TST” if HTS was conducted (and results were given) as part of the outreach activity. If it was a documented complete HTS referral to the facility, it can be counted as HTS_TST_TA. Please refer to the HTS_TST indicator definition sheet for details.","Tracking systems must be able to reduce double-counting of individuals in a reporting period. The numerator can be generated by counting the number of de-duplicated individuals who were reached and had completed the appropriate prevention intervention(s) designed for the intended key population. For example, this means that when a unique individual receives HTS referral plus condoms and lubricant at more than one occasion during the reporting period, **the person is counted only once** for being reached for this indicator.

Furthermore, _**de-duplication of all returning beneficiaries within the Q3-Q4 reporting period (April 1 – September 30) will also need to take place in Q4 reporting if they had already been counted under KP_PREV in Q1-Q2 of the same fiscal year.**_ For example, if an individual had received prevention interventions under KP_PREV through PEPFAR-supported program in January 2020 and was counted as being reached in FY20 Q2 reporting cycle, and this same individual was later reached with prevention services again by PEPFAR-supported program in June 2020, that individual should NOT be reported again in the FY20 Q4 reporting period. This de-duplication is critical to accurately track the _**ANNUAL**_ number of unique individuals reached by PEPFAR within a given fiscal year. Trend analysis of past performance of KP_PREV data will be adversely affected with the change in frequency of KP_PREV reporting from annually to semi-annually if this de-duplication is ignored (i.e., annual number of KP_PREV reported within the same fiscal year would be inflated as the same individual would be counted twice if this de-duplication does not occur at Q4 reporting).

If possible, a unique identifier can be assigned. The use of a unique identifier can help programs monitor the frequency of contact/outreach of a single individual over time (i.e., Beneficiary A with
unique identifier AW0901 had four documented outreach visits in FY20 but was only counted once under KP_PREV in FY20).

Every attempt should be made to ensure the client is linked with HIV testing services that are KP-friendly, and where possible the completed referral should be documented (i.e., the client accessed HIV testing). Note: Persons who access testing and whose results are newly tested HIV-positive in the reporting period should also be counted under “newly tested” even if they return for additional prevention services during that reporting period.


*	**Declined Testing and/or Referral:** Persons who, after explaining the benefits of HIV testing and the reason for testing every 3-6 months (or more/less frequently as indicated by National Guidelines), decline to be tested on-site or referred to a site where HIV testing is offered.

The number of specimens received may also be used to monitor the capacity of testing sites and scale- up efforts over time.
* **Assessing the Clinic-Lab Interface:** The number of specimens received for testing may be used in conjunction with other indicators to monitor the clinic-lab interface.","**Which facilities are counted?**
Collect data for the LAB_PTCQI indicator, both laboratory and POCT, at facilities with PEPFAR-supported laboratories or POCT sites. A PEPFAR-supported laboratory or testing site is defined as a facility that receives direct service delivery (DSD) or technical assistance for service delivery improvement (TA-SDI) from PEPFAR, is the recipient of specimens from PEPFAR-supported clinics, and/or receives proficiency testing panels via PEPFAR support. See definitions for ‘laboratory’ and ‘POCT site’ below.

**How many laboratory-based testing sites are in the facility?**
A facility may have one laboratory-based testing site (e.g., HIV Viral Load laboratory-based testing site), multiple laboratory-based testing sites with different testing categories (e.g., HIV Serology/Diagnostic and HIV Viral Load laboratory-based testing sites), and/or multiple laboratory-based testing sites with the same testing category (e.g., Two HIV Viral Load laboratory-based testing sites - each under a distinct entity/department within the facility).

**How many POCT sites are in the facility?**
A facility may have one POCT site (e.g., HIV Rapid Test POCT site), multiple POCT sites with different testing categories (e.g., HIV Rapid Test POCT site and CD4 POCT site), and/or multiple POCT sites with the same testing category (e.g., Two HIV Serology/Diagnostic test POCT sites – one associated with the PMTCT program and the other associated with the TB program).

**Where can data for this indicator be found?**
Data on engagement in CQI and PT can be obtained from program records of PEPFAR- funded partners. Additionally, laboratory-based testing and POCT site-level documentation can be used to assess CQI engagement and PT results. Data on the number of specimens received for testing can be obtained from specimen registers/log books and/or laboratory information systems (LIS).

**How are data interpreted and reported (Laboratory-Based Testing)?**
Identify the level of engagement in CQI activities for each laboratory-based testing site by choosing one of the following:
* Performs this test but does not participate in CQI (see definition of ‘CQI participation’ below).
* Performs this test and participates in CQI but has not been externally audited (see definition of ‘external audit’ below).
* Performs this test, participates in CQI, and has been externally audited, but does not meet full accreditation standards (see definition of ‘accreditation’ below).
* Performs this test, participates in CQI, has been externally audited, and is fully accredited.

Identify the level of engagement in PT activities for each laboratory-based testing site by choosing one of the following:
* Performs this test but does not participate in PT (see definition of ‘PT participation’ below).
* Performs this test, participates in PT, but did not pass the last round (see definition of ‘passing PT’ below).
* Performs this test, participates in PT, and passed the last round.

Sum the number of specimens received for testing at all laboratory-based testing sites within a testing category. See definition for ‘specimens received for testing’.

**How are data interpreted and reported (Point-of-Care Testing)?**
Identify the level of engagement in CQI activities for each POCT site by choosing one of the following:

    c. HIV viral load
    d. TB diagnostics: Xpert, AFB, or culture
    e. CD4 testing
    f. Rapid Test for Recent Infection

Note: If a point-of-care assay (such as a rapid diagnostic test or Pima CD4) is performed at a laboratory-based testing site, as defined above, data should be reported in the laboratory portion of the indicator LAB_PTCQI indicator.

**Laboratory-based testing site:**
A point within a facility (with a PEPFAR-supported laboratory) that performs one of the tests defined in the testing categories within a laboratory.
**Blood centers/banks:**
Perform any service involved in blood donor recruitment, blood and plasma collection, testing, processing, storage, and distribution of blood and blood products. Stand-alone blood center/banks conducting testing such as screening and/or cross-matching are considered laboratories for this indicator.
**CQI Participation:**
CQI activities implement, improve, or maintain a Quality Management System (QMS). A functioning QMS is essential to provide accurate and reliable results with safety, efficiency, monitoring, and accountability throughout the testing process.
A laboratory-based testing site is counted as participating in CQI if they are engaged in activities within the testing category that are supported by a locally, nationally, regionally or internationally recognized CQI or accreditation preparedness program.
Examples of recognized programs:
A. Strengthening Laboratory Management Towards Accreditation (SLMTA)
B. Other established programs that utilize an auditing process such as WHO AFRO Stepwise Laboratory Quality Improvement Process Towards accreditation (SLIPTA) stepwise processes or CDC/PAHO Caribbean Laboratory Quality Management System Stepwise Improvement Process towards Accreditation (CDC/PAHO LQMS-SIP).
C. Locally-recognized basic laboratory quality management system programs
D. Locally-recognized laboratory mentorship programs
E. Participation in laboratory accreditation programs based on recognized laboratory standards such as African Society for Blood Transfusion (AfSBT), College of American Pathologists (CAP), or International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
**External Audit:**
Refers to a documented assessment conducted by a qualified external auditor. External audits can either be those for accreditation or those to assess readiness for accreditation such as WHO AFRO Stepwise Laboratory Quality Improvement Process Towards Accreditation (SLIPTA) and CDC/PAHO Caribbean Laboratory Quality Management System Stepwise Improvement Process towards Accreditation (CDC/PAHO LQMS-SIP). Internal assessments and audits, including those conducted as part of a training program curriculum; do not count towards this indicator.
**Accreditation:**
Refers to accreditation by a national, regional or internationally recognized accreditation body, such as College of American Pathologists (CAP), International Organization for Standardization (ISO) accreditation programs, regional accreditation bodies such as the South African National Accreditation System (SANAS), African Society for Blood Transfusion (AfSBT), or other approved accreditation organizations. A laboratory-based testing site is assessed by a standardized set of criteria defined by an acceptable national, regional, or international organization. Accreditation certificates are a formal recognition that a laboratory is competent to perform clinical testing. Laboratory-based testing site accreditation status must be current.
**PT Participation:**
Defined as enrollment/participation in a local, national, regional, and/or international external quality assurance or proficiency testing program at any time during the reporting period.
**Passing PT:**
A laboratory-based testing site is counted as passing PT if the last scheduled and completed PT panel was received within the reporting period and was scored as acceptable, successful, or satisfactory by the PT provider. Be aware that scoring systems between PT providers and across test categories may differ. All testing sites that are enrolled in PT should receive a score from the PT provider for each round of PT that is distributed, regardless of whether or not the site reported results.
**Specimen received for testing:**
A specimen is received for testing if its arrival at the laboratory-based testing site was recorded in a register/log book and/or LIS within the reporting timeframe. A specimen received for testing may or may not have been tested/analyzed.

**DEFINITIONS (POINT-OF-CARE TESTING SITES):**

**POCT site:**
A. The site performs testing near or at the place of interaction with the patient/client.
B. The site performs testing in an environment which does not have a formal laboratory infrastructure.
C. Testing at the POCT site is performed by healthcare workers who may not be laboratorians.
D. Conducting POCT in one or more of the following areas:
    a. HIV rapid test
    b. Infant Virologic Testing / Early Infant Diagnosis (IVT/EID)
    c. HIV viral load
    d. TB diagnostics: Xpert or AFB
    e. CD4 testing
    f. Rapid Test for Recent Infection

Notes: Sites conducting HIV rapid testing are considered POCT unless the testing is conducted in a laboratory (see definition of laboratory) by laboratorians. A laboratory-based testing site and POCT site may both be present at a facility. If a point-of-care assay (such as an HIV rapid test or Pima CD4) is performed at a laboratory-based testing site, CQI and PT data should be reported in the laboratory portion of the indicator (LAB_PTCQI (Laboratory)). LAB_PTCQI reporting only applies to facility-based testing. Data on CQI engagement, PT participation, or the number of specimens received for HIV rapid testing (or other POCT) that is conducted outside of a designated health facility (e.g., at a community-level service delivery point) should not be reported for LAB_PTCQI.
**CQI Participation:**
A POCT site is counted as participating in CQI if they are engaged in activities within the defined test category that are supported by a locally, nationally, regionally or internationally recognized CQI or certification preparedness program.
Examples of POCT CQI programs:
A. Rapid Testing Continuous Quality Improvement (RT-CQI)
B. Other established programs that utilize WHO/CDC Stepwise Process for Improving the Quality of HIV rapid testing (SPI-RT) or the WHO/CDC Stepwise process for Improving the Quality of HIV-Related Point-of-Care-Testing (SPI-POCT) Checklists to audit the POCT sites.
C. Locally-recognized basic quality management system programs
D. Locally-recognized laboratory mentorship programs

**External Audit or Certification:**
Refers to a documented assessment conducted by a qualified external auditor. These audits include those for national POCT site certification or for a stepwise quality improvement approaches such as the WHO/CDC Stepwise Process for Improving the Quality of HIV rapid testing (SPI-RT) or the WHO/CDC Stepwise process for Improving the Quality of HIV-Related Point-of-Care-Testing (SPI-POCT) Checklists. Internal assessments and audits, including those conducted as part of a training program curriculum; do not count towards this indicator.
**PT Participation:**
Defined as enrollment/participation in a local, national, regional, and/or international external quality assurance or proficiency testing program within the reporting period. 
**Passing PT:**
A POCT site is counted as passing PT if the last scheduled and completed PT panel was received within the reporting period and scored as acceptable, successful, or satisfactory by the PT provider (see ‘Passing PT’ under laboratory testing for more information). For HIV rapid testing, if multiple testers at a POCT site participate in the same round of PT, >90% of testers must receive a passing PT score of 100% for the POCT site to be reported as passing PT. If the HIV rapid testing PT program provides one PT panel for the site (as opposed to one PT panel for each tester), the POCT site must have a PT score of 100% to be reported as passing PT.
**Specimen received for testing:**
A specimen is received for testing if its arrival at the POCT site was recorded in a register/log book and/or LIS within the reporting timeframe. A specimen received for testing may or may not have been tested/analyzed.

Given the elevated risk of HIV infection among children affected by and vulnerable to HIV, it is imperative for PEPFAR implementing partners to monitor HIV status among OVC beneficiaries, to assess their risk of HIV infection, and to facilitate access and retention in ART treatment for those who are HIV positive. When the implementing partner determines that the child is at risk of HIV infection, the program should refer children for testing and counseling services. When the implementing partner knows the HIV status, the program should ensure that the children are linked to appropriate care and treatment services as an essential element of quality case management. OVC programs should also play an important role in family-centered disclosure, for those who are HIV positive. **The goal of monitoring OVC_HIVSTAT is to increase the proportion of children reported as active or graduated under OVC_SERV under age 18 with a known HIV status or for whom an HIV test is not required based on a risk assessment.**
* This indicator is NOT intended to be an indicator of HIV tests performed or receipt of testing results, as these are measured elsewhere, and confirmed test results are frequently unavailable to community organizations due to health facility concerns about patient confidentiality.
* This indicator is NOT intended to imply that all OVC beneficiaries require an HIV test. OVC with known positive or negative status do not need to be tested. OVC with unknown HIV status should be assessed for risk, and if determined to be at risk, should be referred or otherwise supported, to access HTS. For younger children who are determined not to be at risk (“test not required based on risk assessment”) reassessment of risk will only be needed in cases where their risk situation changes (i.e., in cases of child sexual abuse). Older children whom the IP thinks may be sexually active should be assessed every reporting period. An HIV risk assessment should always occur prior to HIV testing to determine if a test is required.
* Status disclosure to the implementing partner is NOT a prerequisite for enrollment or continuation in an OVC program. OVC programs serve persons of positive, negative, and unknown HIV status appropriate to their needs and vulnerability to HIV. This indicator ensures that IPs are regularly providing outreach to caregivers to identify children’s HIV status, encouraging family disclosure, and linking to care and treatment services as needed.
* This indicator captures if implementing partners are tracking the self-reported HIV status of the OVC that they serve and enrollment in ART for those who are positive. Testing results for OVC who are referred for testing should be reported under HTS_TST based on the service delivery point where they are tested.
* This indicator also captures if implementing partners are tracking if the OVC that they serve who report to be HIV positive are successfully linked to and retained in treatment and care. ART treatment status should be recorded both at the time of enrollment as well as at regular intervals at least once during the reporting period.
* Since this is not a testing indicator, HIV positivity yield should NOT be calculated based on this indicator. Yield calculations should only be made by testing partners.
* A helpful way to assess OVC_HIVSTAT performance is to create a “known status proxy” category of known status/risk (by combining those reported positive, negative, and those who have been risk assessed and found to not require a test) and compare this with OVC_SERV <18. This analysis encourages programs to actively follow-up on all instances of “HIV status unknown” by targeting instances of missing data, nondisclosure, and issues with reporting timing. While OVC_HIVSTAT as a percentage of OVC_SERV
<18 historically intended to identify gaps in IP tracking of HIV status of OVC, this updated way of reviewing the data provides insight into OVC with known status and identifies where additional follow-up is needed for those with unknown status.
* This indicator is a subset from OVC_SERV. Only OVC who were reported under OVC_SERV <18 should be included in the denominator for this indicator.
* DREAMS beneficiaries under 18 who are reported under OVC_SERV should also be reported under OVC_HIVSTAT where feasible, as should beneficiaries of 9-14 primary prevention of sexual violence and HIV interventions.
","Data sources for this indicator include HIV test results that are self-reported by OVC (or their caregivers), results of HIV Risk Assessments conducted by implementing partners, registers, referral forms, client records, or other confidential case management and program monitoring tools that track those in treatment and care.

Implementation of the HIV risk assessment should be integrated into case management and on-going case monitoring, and should not be conducted separately, if possible. This will vary by partner and project. The partners should work out a timeline based on their experience of how long referral completion and status disclosure usually takes and factor that into their case management processes.

Implementing partners will record the OVC beneficiary’s self-reported HIV status semi- annually.

**Reporting Scenarios:**
**Q1.** Daniel reports to the community health worker (CHW) that he is negative, but his last test was two years ago. Is Daniel still reported as “Negative”, or as “No Status”, and needs to be risk assessed?
**A1.** Based on their knowledge of the child from case management records, if the CHW believes that the child has no risk of HIV infection (i.e., no one in the household is HIV+, they are not exposed to violence, child is not sexually active yet) then getting another test done is not necessary and would report them as negative. This applies mainly to younger children under age 12 (depends on average age of sexual debut in the country). For adolescents, we recommend getting risk assessed if the test was not conducted in the reporting period.
In that same scenario, what if the CHW decides to administer the HIV Risk Assessment to Daniel and finds that an HIV test is not indicated, how should that be reported? This should be reported as “Test Not Required Based on Risk Assessment” because once the CHW decides to conduct a risk assessment, this means that the child’s status is in question and that should be captured as No Status.

**Q2.** Elizabeth reports to the CHW that she is negative and had an HIV test within the past 6 months, but the CHW knows that she was recently exposed to something that could put her at high risk (e.g., GBV, sexually active), what should the CHW do?
**A2.** Because the CHW thinks that Elizabeth may be at risk of HIV infection, the CHW would conduct the risk assessment and she is no longer reported as “Reported HIV Negative”. If found at risk (e.g., GBV exposure) then she should be referred for testing. If determined to be Test Not Required Based on Risk Assessment Elizabeth would be captured as “Test Not Required Based on Risk Assessment”.

If she completes the testing within the reporting period and the caregiver is willing to disclose the result of the test, her response would be captured accordingly.
If she is risk assessed and referred for testing, but her caregiver is not able/willing to complete the test or disclose the status within the reporting period it is captured as “No HIV Status”. Hopefully by the following reporting period, the caregiver will have completed the referral and disclosed the child's status so it can be captured as positive or negative. It is understandable that the whole process from risk assessment to referral completion and disclosure may not be completed within 6 months and there be movement from “No HIV Status” to “Reported HIV positive” or “Reported HIV Negative” in future reporting periods.

**Q3.** What do we do when a caregiver refuses to disclose their status and the status of their child or refuses to complete an HIV test – even when the HIV risk screening tool indicates that their child is at high risk of HIV infection?
**A3.** A caregiver should never be forced to disclose their or their child’s status, the results of an HIV test, or to complete an HIV test. HIV status and completion of an HIV test are not required for enrollment in an OVC program. If a child is believed to be at high risk of HIV and the caregiver is reluctant to disclose results or complete a test, OVC programs should attempt to facilitate a meeting with the caregiver, and persons specially trained on HIV disclosure. OVC programs may also consider enlisting the support of community members with whom the caregiver has greater trust. Until the client chooses to disclose test results, status under OVC_HIVSTAT should be recorded as “No HIV Status.”

**Q4.** How do we report on HIV exposed infants who are still too young to have had their final HIV status testing?
**A4.** Because HIV-exposed infants may be tested at multiple points prior to receiving a final HIV status, we recommend that they be counted as ""no status"" until such time that the clinic determines their final status as positive (infected) or negative (not infected). A note can be entered in DATIM in the narrative section indicating the number of children entered as ""no status"" that are HIV-exposed (i.e., infants during the reporting period who were of
undetermined status). It is important for all HIV-exposed infants and their caregivers to be facilitated to make appointments deemed necessary by the clinic.
","The OVC_HIVSTAT total numerator should equal OVC_SERV<18 results total numerator, including active and graduated. Review any site with the following reporting issues: 1) numerator greater than 100% of OVC_SERV <age 18, and 2) very low coverage of OVC_HIVSTAT (defined as OVC_HIVSTAT numerator divided by OVC_SERV <18) which provides data on reporting of status.

Missing data should be documented under “HIV status unknown” or “Reported HIV positive- Not currently receiving ART or ART status unknown.” Potential reasons for missing data may include: 1) IP was not able to collect information from all caregivers of OVC_SERV<18 within the reporting period, 2) IP was not able to locate all the caregivers of OVC_SERV<18 (e.g., relocated, migrant work).
",This is a snapshot indicator. Results are cumulative at each reporting period.,"**Disaggregate Groups and Disaggregates**

        * Not currently receiving ART or ART status unknown
    * Reported HIV negative to implementing partner
    * Test not required based on risk assessment
    * No HIV status reported to the implementing partner (HIV status unknown)
",**See OVC_SERV.**,"**Status Type Disaggregate Definitions:**
* **“Reported HIV positive to IP”** includes beneficiaries <age 18 who report to the IP that they are HIV positive based on an HIV test conducted during or prior to the reporting period (regardless of where the test occurred). All beneficiaries <age 18 who report to the IP that they are HIV positive based on an HIV test conducted during or prior to the reporting period (regardless of where the test occurred) should be reported as **“currently receiving ART”** or **“not currently receiving ART or ART Status Unknown.”** This also includes beneficiaries <age 18 who report that they are HIV positive based on an HIV test conducted during previous project reporting periods. OVC entered in either category as “Reported HIV positive– currently receiving ART” or “Reported HIV positive– not currently receiving ART or ART Status Unknown” in the previous reporting period should be followed in the current reporting period and their current ART treatment status noted. In order to be counted as “currently receiving ART” the IP should confirm at the last visit preceding the reporting month whether the response to the following questions is “yes” to ensure that this captures more than just initial linkage to care: Do you have enough ART pills to take until the date of your next appointment?
* **“Reported HIV negative to IP”** includes beneficiaries <age 18 who report that they are HIV negative to the IP based on an HIV test conducted during the reporting period (regardless of where the test occurred). For a child who reports multiple tests within the current period, use most recent test. For beneficiaries entered as “Reported HIV negative to IP” in a previous reporting period—if the IP believes the child’s risk has not changed in the last six months, they should continue to report the child as negative during the current reporting period. However, if the IP believes that the child has recently been exposed to risk of HIV infection (e.g., sexual violence) or if an adolescent has become sexually active, then the IP should conduct the HIV risk assessment. Potential outcomes reported after the HIV risk assessment include 1) the child is tested and reported as HIV positive and either currently receiving ART or not receiving ART or ART status unknown, or 2) the child is tested and reported as HIV negative, 3) the child is reported as “No HIV Status reported to the IP”, or 4) the child is reported as “Test not required based on risk assessment.”
* **“Test not required based on risk assessment”** includes beneficiaries (OVC_SERV<age 18) who based on a risk assessment made by the implementing partner do not require a test during the reporting period (formerly known as test not indicated). (Consensus Conference Technical Report on the Role of OVC Programs Supported by PEPFAR in Extending Access to HTS includes further information on determining whether a test is required).
* **“No HIV status reported to the IP”** (HIV status unknown) includes all beneficiaries
<age 18 who do not fit in the above categories and who report to the IP that they do not know their HIV status or for whom HIV status is missing. Potential scenarios for reporting a child in this category include:
    * Not yet assessed: Child enrolled in program, but not yet assessed for HIV risk.
    * Refuse HIV assessment: Caregiver has been approached, but did not agree to let the IP conduct a risk assessment on the child in the reporting period.
    * At risk for HIV: Child has been assessed and is at risk for HIV, but caregiver has not yet taken child to be tested (including if they have refused testing referral or if they have accepted the referral but not yet completed the test).
    * HIV referral completed: OVC has completed HIV test, but result is not available OR caregiver doesn’t report results to IP in the reporting period.
    * Refuse report: Caregiver has been approached by IP but have not yet agreed to disclose whether the child has been tested and his/her current HIV status in the reporting period
    * Missing: No available data, including because an IP did not attempt to find out about a child’s status.

We recommend that IPs aim to move a newly enrolled OVC with HIV Status Unknown through the assessment cascade within the reporting period. A newly enrolled child would initially be considered “HIV Status Unknown” until he/she is risk assessed. If the OVC is found to not be at risk at present, he/she will be noted as “Test not required based on risk assessment.” If the OVC is found to be at risk, he/she will be referred for HIV testing and then the program will work with the guardian to disclose the results until he/she can be reported as “Reported HIV Negative”, “Reported HIV Positive – currently on ART” or “Reported HIV Positive – not currently on ART or ART status unknown”.

For children reported as ”HIV Status Unknown” in the previous reporting period, the IP should ensure that child is risk assessed, referred for testing if needed, and supported to disclose new test results. Children reported as “Test not required based on risk assessment” with no changes in their risk situation for the past six months, don’t need to be reassessed. If the IP believes the child’s risk situation has changed in the last six months, then the child should be reassessed by the implementing partner to determine whether testing is indicated and the results entered as outline above, and the child should receive
appropriate follow-up.
",,,"Modifications to standard definition of DSD and TA-SDI related to eligible goods and services:

**Provision of key staff or eligible goods/services for OVC beneficiaries receiving care and support services in the community include:** For beneficiaries of OVC services, this can include funding of salaries (partial or full) for staff of the organization delivering the individual, small group or community level activity (e.g., psychosocial support, child protection services, education, etc.). Partial salary support may include stipends or incentives for volunteers/para-social workers or paying for transportation of those staff to the point of service delivery. For goods or services to be eligible, goods or services (e.g., bursaries, cash transfers, uniforms) can either be paid for out of the implementing partner’s budget or be provided as a result of the IP’s efforts to leverage and mobilize non-project resources. For example, an IP may help beneficiaries fill out and file forms necessary for the receipt of government provided cash transfers, social grants, or bursaries for which they are eligible. Given the focus on long-term local ownership, IP’s are encouraged to mobilize goods and services whenever possible.

**For care and support services, ongoing support for OVC service delivery for improvement includes:** the development of activity-related curricula, education materials, etc., supportive supervision of volunteers, support for setting quality standards and/or ethical guidelines, and monitoring visits to assess the quality of the activity, including a home visit, a visit to a school to verify a child’s attendance and progress in school or observation of a child’s participation in kids clubs.

Mitigating the impact that HIV is having on children and the families that support them is integral to a comprehensive HIV response. It is important to note that the definition of “affected” children includes, but is not limited to, children living with HIV and children at risk of HIV infection.
PEPFAR recognizes that individuals, families, and communities are affected by HIV in ways that may hinder the medical outcomes of HIV-positive persons as well as the emotional and physical development of children orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS. A variety of services are supported through PEPFAR to mitigate these effects in order to improve health and well-being outcomes of children and adults to contribute to epidemic control. The goal of OVC programs is to build stability and resiliency in children and families who are exposed, living with, at risk of, or affected by HIV/AIDS. This is achieved through rigorous case management and provision of and access to health and socio-economic interventions.

This indicator is a direct (output) measure of the number of individuals receiving PEPFAR OVC program services for children and families affected by HIV/AIDS. The total numerator of this indicator is disaggregated by Program Participation Status: “active” to track the number of OVC and caregivers actively enrolled in an OVC program and receiving services, and “graduated” to track the number of OVC and caregivers graduating from PEPFAR OVC programs. Graduation requires that each child and caregiver in the household achieve a global set of minimum benchmarks. These graduation benchmarks purposefully set a high standard for children and caregivers to exit the program in a stable situation. Partners may include additional benchmarks based on local criteria for achieving stability, but all PEPFAR agencies and programs receiving HKID funding for OVC programs must adopt the eight minimum benchmarks. Exceptions to use of the benchmarks when counting OVC beneficiaries are outlined in the “Disaggregate descriptions and definitions” section below.

Additional disaggregates for “transferred out to a PEPFAR-supported partner”, “transferred out to a non-PEPFAR supported partner”, and “exited without graduation”, while not included in the total numerator, capture critical information on the differing situations of children who have left the program and track the movement of children and their caregivers between PEPFAR and host-country programs that provide a sustainable response to OVC needs. Transfers to host-government services for unstable households in geographic areas not prioritized by PEPFAR should be counted as transfers to non-PEPFAR supported programs.

Illustrative eligible interventions have been added to this guidance to ensure that children (and their caregivers) counted as “active” receive substantive, timely, and regular support based on a needs assessment after enrollment. See **Appendix E**.","Data sources include PEPFAR OVC program registers and other records of program data generated by implementing partners. Implementing partners’ registers need to record names of children and caregivers, likely requiring use of a unique ID system, who meet the criteria for “active beneficiary” or “graduated” to generate the numerator total and disaggregates included in this indicator. Each individual should be counted only once under OVC_SERV in the reporting period. In addition to counting active and graduated beneficiaries, implementing partners should record whether children or caregivers “transferred out to a PEPFAR-supported partner”, “transferred out to a non-PEPFAR supported partner”, or “exited without graduation.” The program participation status and transfer/exit disaggregate categories are mutually exclusive.

All agencies and programs receiving HKID funding are required to report on this indicator.

Please note that there is specific guidance related to graduation. PEPFAR guidance for graduation from an OVC project includes the following eight benchmarks that are required for all OVC programs (see **Appendix F** for additional details and definitions).

Reporting scenarios and frequently asked questions for OVC reporting are included in **Appendix G**.","Review PEPFAR OVC implementing partners’ results to ensure that there is no double counting. Review IP and site results for deviations from one period to the next which may indicate rapid exit and entry of beneficiaries or high sudden graduation rate in one, versus another period.

Age/sex disaggregates will auto-sum the total numerator.","To calculate data for annual results for OVC_SERV: Sum the reported number of Q4 Active (children and caregivers who received services in each of the preceding two quarters (Q3 + Q4)) + Q4 Graduated (all OVC that graduated from the OVC program in the fiscal year).

Q4 OVC_SERV = (Active Q4) + (Graduated Q4)

Individuals should only be counted once by each partner at Q4 reporting, and the graduated, exited, and transferred disaggregates should be reported cumulatively at Q4. Program participation status at the end of Q4 should take precedence for where to count an individual (i.e., if a beneficiary was counted as exited without graduation at Q2 but had met the criteria to be counted as active at Q4, then they should be reported at Q4 only under the active category and not in the total reported for exited without graduation). The exits, graduations, and transfers are a snapshot for the entire fiscal year at the time of reporting
(either Q2 or Q4).

    * **Exited without graduation** (At Q2: Report the number of children and caregivers that exited in the past two quarters. At Q4: Report the number of children and parents/caregivers that exited in the past four quarters and did not return to active status (i.e., those who are
exited without graduation as of the last day of the reporting period)
",N/A,"**Program Participation Status Definitions:**
* **“Active beneficiary” is an individual, a child or caregiver, who has received at least one PEPFAR OVC program service in each of the preceding two quarters. New beneficiaries enrolled during the reporting period can be counted as active only if they have received at least one service in the last quarter.** For OVC_SERV, a caregiver fulfills the role of parent or guardian, and there should be no more than two primary caregivers per household. In most cases, given the vulnerability status of the households PEPFAR serves, there is likely to be only one primary caregiver (i.e., parent/guardian). While adults or household members who are not caregivers fulfilling the role of parent or guardian may indirectly benefit from program support or access a one-time service, they should not be counted, as that does not meet the intention of increasing primary caregivers’ access to critical services and support.

Active OVC_SERV beneficiaries include several, potentially overlapping, categories of recipients with the following requirements:
1. **Child beneficiary** (“OVC”) aged 0-17 (note: children aged 18 to 20 still completing secondary education or an approved economic intervention intended to secure the livelihood of an OVC aging out of the program may be included):
    a. Has a case plan that has been developed (or updated) in last 12 months
    b. Continues to be monitored at least quarterly, but as often as is necessary according to the child’s safety, schooling, stability, and health status. Monitoring includes establishing contact in person, or virtually where needed, to ensure that the case plan is progressing, and documentation of this contact is recorded in the case plan.
    c. Has received directly from the project, was facilitated to obtain, or has a completed referral for at least one intervention in each of the preceding two quarters (see **Appendix E** for illustrative eligible interventions; if a service is not included on this list, the partner must seek and receive approval from local USG funding agency and note this in the OVC_SERV narrative). Intake assessment,
enrollment, subsequent assessments including HIV risk assessment, case plan development, and case plan monitoring are considered critical administrative processes rather than services but remain critical to ensuring provision of needs-based services in a timely manner.

2. **Caregiver beneficiary** (primarily aged 18+) of an OVC (child/adolescent aged 0-17 or 18-20 still completing secondary education or an approved economic intervention intended to secure the livelihood of an OVC aging out of the program) who has met the following criteria:
    a. Has received directly from the project, was facilitated to obtain, or has a completed referral for at least one caregiver intervention in each of the preceding two quarters (see **Appendix E** for illustrative eligible interventions).
    b. In addition, select services, including parenting, household economic strengthening, and food security interventions (specified in **Appendix E** in the caregiver and child column), qualify both the caregiver and OVC to be counted as active.

3. **Active DREAMS beneficiary aged 10-17**
    a. An active DREAMS beneficiary who is not otherwise actively enrolled in an OVC program must receive a DREAMS service/intervention that is also included in the list of OVC_SERV illustrative services (**Appendix E**). They should be counted as “active” in the reporting period in which they received an eligible service. These individuals are not required to have an OVC case plan or to be monitored using the OVC graduation benchmarks, thus they will never be reported under the graduated, exited, or transferred disaggregates. Active DREAMS beneficiaries should also be counted under the AGYW_PREV indicator according to their layering status.
    b. Active DREAMS beneficiaries aged 18+ who are not otherwise actively enrolled in an OVC program should **NOT** be counted under OVC_SERV.

4. **Children aged 9-14 receiving only a primary prevention of HIV & sexual violence intervention**
_Prevention of HIV and sexual violence are important services that fit under the core benchmarks of the OVC program. Delivery of these services may differ from the comprehensive OVC program._
    a. A child (boy or girl) aged 9-14 who is not otherwise actively receiving services in the comprehensive OVC program, but who is receiving an approved primary prevention intervention through a community entry point should be counted as “active” in the fiscal year in which they complete the intervention. At Q2, report the number of beneficiaries who completed an approved primary prevention intervention in the past two quarters. At Q4, report the number of beneficiaries who completed an approved primary prevention intervention in the past four quarters and did not become enrolled in the comprehensive OVC program.
    b. These individuals are not required to have an OVC case plan or to be monitored using the OVC graduation benchmarks, thus they will never be reported under the graduated, exited, or transferred disaggregates.
    c. Approved primary prevention of sexual violence and HIV interventions are as follows: Families Matter Program, Sinovuyo Teen, Coaching Boys into Men, IMpower, and Stepping Stones. Countries are strongly encouraged to implement one of these five pre-approved curricula. All other curricula used for 9-14 primary prevention must be approved by S/GAC and the relevant agency HQ and must include the three S/GAC evidence-informed modules on healthy and unhealthy relationships, healthy choices about sex, and understanding non- consensual sex.

* **“Graduation”** is defined as the point at which a household enrolled in a PEPFAR OVC program is deemed to have become more stable and is no longer in need of project- provided services. For caregivers and children <18 (or aged 18- 20 and completing secondary education or an approved economic intervention intended to secure the livelihood of an OVC aging out of the program) to be counted as an individual graduated in DATIM, all child and all caregiver beneficiaries in a household must meet all applicable (age and HIV status specific) graduation benchmarks established by PEPFAR for improving stability in the household. **For the purposes of graduation, a household is defined as all children in the household/family unit less than age 18 years and their caregiver(s) (not to exceed two people fulfilling the role of parent or guardian per household/family unit).** PEPFAR guidance for graduation from an OVC project includes the following eight benchmarks (see **Appendix F** for additional details, definitions, and data sources), which align with the illustrative services in **Appendix E**. Countries may include additional benchmarks, but the eight global benchmarks are a minimum requirement.

**Graduation Benchmarks:**

* **DOMAIN: HEALTHY**
        * BENCHMARK 1.1.1: All children, adolescents, and caregivers in the household have known HIV status or a test is not required based on risk assessment
        * BENCHMARK 1.2.1.
            * a) All HIV+ children, adolescents and caregivers in the household with a viral load result documented in the medical record and/or laboratory information systems (LIS) have been virally suppressed for the last 12 months.
_OR_ If viral load testing or viral load testing results are unavailable at clinic treating HIV+ beneficiaries, then:
            * (b) All HIV+ children, adolescents, and caregivers in the household have adhered to treatment for 12 months after initiation of antiretroviral therapy
            * BENCHMARK 1.3.1.: All adolescents 10-17 years of age in the household have key knowledge about preventing HIV infection
            * BENCHMARK 1.4.1.: No children < 5 years in the household are undernourished
* **DOMAIN: STABLE**
        * BENCHMARK 2.1: Caregivers are able to access money (without selling productive assets) to pay for school fees and medical costs for children aged 0-17
* **DOMAIN: SAFE**
        * BENCHMARK 3.1.1.: No children, adolescents, and caregivers in the household report experiences of violence (including physical violence, emotional violence, sexual violence, gender-based violence, and neglect) in the last 6 months
        * BENCHMARK 3.1.2.: All children and adolescents in the household are under the care of a stable adult caregiver
* **DOMAIN: SCHOOLED**
        * BENCHMARK 4.1.1: All school-age children and adolescents in the household regularly attended school and progressed in school during the last year

**Exited or Transferred Disaggregate Definitions:**
* **“Transferred out to a non-PEPFAR-supported partner”** is defined as when a child or caregiver beneficiary has transitioned to programs that are not PEPFAR funded. These could include country-led services or other donor-funded programs.
* **“Transferred out to a PEPFAR-supported partner”** is defined as when a child or caregiver beneficiary has transitioned from the support of one PEPFAR partner to another PEPFAR partner.
* **“Exited without graduation”** is defined as when a child or caregiver has not received program services in each of the past two preceding quarters or is lost-to-follow up, re- located, died, or the child has aged-out of the program without the household meeting graduation benchmarks from the PEPFAR OVC program.

Program participation status categories (i.e., active, graduated, exited without graduation, transferred out to a non-PEPFAR-supported partner, and transferred out to a PEPFAR- supported partner) are mutually exclusive such that an individual should be counted under only one category per partner, per reporting period.
",,,"Modifications to standard definition of DSD and TA-SDI related to eligible goods and services:

**Provision of key staff or eligible goods/services for OVC beneficiaries receiving care and support services in the community includes:** For beneficiaries of OVC services, this can include funding of salaries (partial or full) for staff of the organization delivering the individual, small group, or community level activity (e.g., psychosocial support, child protection services, education, etc.). Partial salary support may include stipends or incentives for volunteers/para-social workers or paying for transportation of those staff to the point of service delivery. For goods or services to be eligible, goods or services (e.g., bursaries, cash transfers, uniforms) can either be paid for out of the implementing partner’s budget or be provided as a result of the IPs efforts to leverage and mobilize non-project resources. For example, an IP may help beneficiaries fill out and file forms necessary for the receipt of government provided cash transfers, social grants, or bursaries for which they are eligible. Given the focus on long-term local ownership, IPs are encouraged to mobilize goods and services whenever possible.

**For care and support services, ongoing support for OVC service delivery for improvement includes:** the development of activity-related curricula, education materials, etc., supportive supervision of volunteers, support for setting quality standards and/or ethical guidelines, and monitoring visits to assess the quality of the activity, including a home visit, a visit to a school to verify a child’s attendance and progress in school or observation of a child’s participation in kids’ clubs.","1.

",None,Facility,Quarterly,Track progress toward ensuring that all pregnant women who attend PEPFAR-supported antenatal care (ANC) know their HIV status and are initiated on ART.,"Data source is the ANC or PMTCT register depending on country context (in many high HIV prevalence settings information on the number of women receiving ART regimens is integrated into the ANC register). There is a risk of double counting, as a pregnant woman receiving ART at ANC should have multiple visits for each pregnancy. Therefore partners should ensure a data collection and reporting system is in place to minimize double counting of the same pregnant woman across visits including a paper based longitudinal ANC or PMTCT register (meaning a register that is able to record all information about 1 pregnancy in one location, with rows or columns that allow for recording information on multiple visits during that pregnancy) or an electronic medical record/patient tracking system. There is also a risk of undercounting if those women who are already on ART prior to attending ANC are not documented, therefore the ANC register should document both “New on ART” and “Already on ART at the beginning of the current pregnancy”.

Note: Those women reported in PMTCT_ART including newly enrolled on ART and already on ART at the beginning of pregnancy should also be reported in the TX_NEW and TX_CURR indicators, respectively. Women who are already on ART should not be counted in TX_NEW. PMTCT_ART is about initiation of ART (yes/no) or already on ART (yes/no).
This will most likely be captured at ANC1 but may be captured at a future ANC visit.
Women initiated on ART during L&D or breastfeeding should not be reported under PMTCT_ART but should still be reported under TX_NEW.
","Review any site with over 100% coverage or very low coverage to ensure they reflect expected results. In general, services should be reported at the site where they are delivered (however PMTCT_ART- “already on treatment” and PMTCT_STAT_POS “known positive at entry” are exceptions, see details under description of disaggregate below).
Therefore, coverage at site level must be understood within the context of the service delivery model at that site. For example, in local areas where ART is integrated into ANC and low volume PMTCT sites are only testing for HIV and then referring women to other facilities for ART, the expectation is that for one individual PMTCT_STAT_POS (newly tested) will be documented at one facility and PMTCT_ART (new on ART) would be documented at another facility leading to the appearance of greater than >100% coverage

* The number of HIV-positive pregnant women already on ART at beginning of pregnancy: May be counted even if ART is continuing to be received at another facility. For example, a woman who is already on treatment becomes pregnant and enrolls in ANC/PMTCT because she is HIV-positive but is continuing to receive her ART at a nearby treatment clinic should be counted within this disaggregate.

It will help measure trends in coverage of antiretroviral prophylaxis and treatment, and when disaggregated by regimen type, will also assess progress in implementing more effective antiretroviral therapy regimens. As the indicator usually measures ARVs dispensed and not those consumed, it is not possible to determine adherence to the regimen in most cases.

The indicator is disaggregated by the age of the infant at the time of sample collection, specifically between birth and 2 months and between 2 and 12 months of age.

Only samples collected for the first virologic test for each HIV-exposed infant should be counted in this indicator, including dried blood spots (DBS) and samples collected for POC testing (e.g., Alere, Xpert). Even though there is ongoing exposure of infants to HIV (through breastfeeding), this indicator only measures access to a first test, and not access to all the recommended HIV tests throughout breastfeeding. HIV status of infants at the end of the breastfeeding period and the outcomes of the PMTCT program are measured in PMTCT_FO.

The positive results of HIV infant virologic testing are collected under the PMTCT_HEI_POS indicator. Please see the reference sheet for PMTCT_HEI_POS for more information.
Implementing partners should report on all infants whose samples were collected for a first virologic test, even if no test result has been recorded in the patient record/register at the time of reporting.

This indicator should be collected from the clinical source (i.e., HIV-exposed infant registers or patient records) to ensure unduplicated patient counting. HIV-exposed infant registers should be used to count exposed infants and samples collected for virologic testing. (If available, information could come from electronic systems). If the standard report does not contain all the required information, individual patient files should be used. Additional supporting information for this indicator can be obtained from standard laboratory information systems (i.e., DNA PCR or POC/near POC log books or electronic systems) however, it will be important to ensure that repeat tests of the same sample or HIV-infected infants receiving a confirmatory virologic HIV test result are not counted twice.

A virologic test is a test used for HIV diagnosis in infants up to 18 months of age. The most commonly used form of virologic testing or nucleic acid testing (“NAT”) is HIV DNA PCR on dried blood spots (DBS) but this indicator also includes samples collected for POC testing. Three other types of testing should not be reported: 1) Serologic testing of children should not be reported in this indicator. (See HTS_TST for additional details). 2) Virologic tests conducted with the purpose of confirming the diagnosis of HIV, 3) Virologic tests used for clinical monitoring of children on ART, such as viral load quantification. **Additionally, only the first sample collected should be counted for each infant, even if they have had more than one virologic test done.**

The numerator is divided into first sample collected between birth and 2 months of age and first sample collected between 2 and 12 months of age. The 0-2 month and 2-12-month age periods are based on age at collection of sample, not on date of result return to the facility or caregiver. It is likely that at the time of reporting there will be samples that have been
collected but for which no result is documented in the register or patient record.","Infant testing coverage (PMTCT_EID / PMTCT_STAT_POS + HTS_TST_POS from the Post ANC1: Pregnancy/L&D/BF modality) is a proxy calculation, relying on PMTCT_STAT_POS + HTS_TST_POS from the Post ANC1: Pregnancy/L&D/BF modality as a proxy denominator for the total number of HIV exposed infants (HEI). Reviewing infants with a first virologic test (N) against these denominator results) should be done carefully—see assumptions and limitations below. Review of outlier percentages for testing coverage by age band is recommended (e.g., review high and low outliers for 0-≤2-month testing coverage disaggregate).

Assumption: the total number of HIV positive pregnant and breastfeeding women, and therefore HEI, does not significantly vary quarter by quarter. We would not expect all the women reported under PMTCT_STAT_POS to have given birth to the infants reported under PMTCT_EID. However, despite that time period mismatch, the assumption is that the total number of HIV positive women (estimated HEI) does not vary significantly quarter by quarter, so it is reasonable to compare infants tested to the STAT_POS & HTS_TST_POS PostANC1: Pregnancy/L&D/BF denominator from the same reporting time period.

See the PMTCT_HEI_POS indicator reference sheet for a description of considerations and limitations in calculating proxy positivity for HEI (PMTCT_HEI_POS / PMTCT_EID).

FY20 (v2.4),PMTCT_FO,Concept,PEPFAR,MER,PMTCT_FO,Reference Indicator,FY20,v2.4,Testing,Percentage of final outcomes among HIV exposed infants registered in a birth cohort,"Number of HIV-exposed infants with a documented outcome by 18 months of age disaggregated by outcome type.

(Note: Collection of 18 month visit outcomes is recommended at 24 months of age, see additional explanation to the right.)
","Calculated indicator in DATIM, sum of: HIV- infected, HIV-uninfected, HIV-final status unknown, died without status known.

It is recommended to wait to collect the 18 month visit outcomes until the patient is 24 months old for the following reasons: 1) this allows for children who present several months late to their 18 month visit to be included in the numerator and 2) cohort reporting is easiest when monthly reporting by facilities is used and where the birth month and the reporting month are the same calendar month (i.e., for infants born in January 2012, their 24 month reporting month would be January 2014, rather than using the 18 month reporting month of July 2013).
",Number of HIV-exposed infants who were born 24 months prior to the reporting period and registered in the birth cohort.,Only those HIV-exposed infants registered in the birth cohort at any time between 0 and 18 months of age (including transfers-ins) who were born 24 months prior to the reporting period are included in the denominator.,None,Facility,Annually,"In settings where national guidelines support breastfeeding of HIV-exposed infants, antibody testing of all HIV-exposed children at 18 months of age and/or 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding is recommended to determine final HIV status (‘final outcome’/FO) of HIV-exposed children. To accomplish this goal, it is recommended to identify infants at birth or at the first infant follow-up visit and track them through the end of the breastfeeding period. This indicator measures progress toward ensuring that all infants born to HIV-positive women have an outcome documented. In settings where a mother- infant register is utilized and/or it is common practice for HIV-infected women to breastfeed less than or more than 18 months please describe in the narrative the final outcome time point.","To report on this indicator PEPFAR supported sites would ideally use registers or facility held cards for HIV exposed infants that collect longitudinal information on follow-up and are organized by birth month of infants. This methodology is referred to as birth cohort reporting.

Two examples of birth cohort reporting:
1. In Kenya, this indicator was first piloted by PEPFAR and the Ministry of Health in Western Kenya and is currently integrated into the national HIV summary reporting tool. Data from the facility HIV exposed infant longitudinal follow-up register, which organizes infants by birth-month cohorts, are aggregated into a report summarizing outcomes for infants reaching 24 months of age during each month.
2. In Malawi, clinic staff complete monthly follow up reporting forms as part of the national quarterly supervision visits using data collected directly from HIV-exposed infant cards which are kept in a binder that is organized by birth month (no HIV exposed register is used).

As an example, for those infants born in FY 2018, the outcomes would be reported in FY 2020.

**FY 2020 (Report results for the entire 12-month reporting period for these indicators at the Q4 reporting cycle)**

Both approaches allow a paper-based health facility records to quickly identify the number of HIV-exposed infants registered in the birth cohort at any time between - and 18 months of age (denominator).","By design this indicator should equal 100% if all outcomes are known regardless of outcome type. This allows for facilities to check that all HIV-exposed infants have an outcome assigned to them during the reporting process. Data utilization requires reviewing the disaggregated data to understand the specific outcomes of interest. In settings where HIV-exposed infant registers do not allow for documentation of all disaggregated outcomes, country teams should report only on available disaggregates even if the aggregate indicator is less than 100%, however this should be specified in the narrative.

The denominator should include those “Transferred In” and those “Transferred Out” as long as for “Transferred In” there is documentation that HIV-exposed infants were registered at their original site in the birth cohort at any time between 0 and 18 months of age and were born 24 months prior to the reporting period. “Transferred Out” should be reported under HIV status unknown. The inclusion of Transfers-In/Out provides a quality check to ensure that all exposed infants have an outcome assigned to them during the reporting process such that the sum of the numerator disaggregation equals the denominator. However, this may lead to outcomes for >100% of HIV positive pregnant women (PMTCT_STAT_POS) identified at a site so this comparison should not be used as a logic check.

",N/A,"**Outcome Type:**
For the numerator to be calculated, implementing partners are required to report:
* HIV-infected: Number of HIV-exposed infants identified as HIV-infected at any point during follow-up. HIV-infected includes infants and children with diagnostic virologic or serologic confirmation of HIV-infection (DNA PCR before 18 months; rapid test at 18 months) and those with a presumptive HIV diagnosis where DNA PCR is not available. Site should also maintain data on HIV infected infants and whether they are linked or not linked to ART services, or whether they have no information on patient linkage to ART programs.
* HIV-uninfected: Number of HIV-exposed infants with a negative 18-month antibody test documented. Based on national guidelines, countries should determine if “HIV- uninfected” includes infants with a documented negative antibody test that was done at least 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding but before 18 months of age.
* HIV final status unknown: Sum of the following disaggregates (not reported in DATIM but should be documented at site level)
    * In care but no test done: Number of HIV-exposed infants who attended 18-month visit but no antibody test result is documented (unknown FO)
    * Lost to follow-up: Number of HIV-exposed infants who did not attend the 18-month visit (unknown FO)

* Died without status known: Number of HIV-exposed infants who are documented to have died without confirmation of HIV-infection between 0 and 18 months. Note: HIV- exposed infants who are HIV infected and later confirmed to have died or transferred out during follow-up are still counted under HIV infected and not died or transferred out.

FY20 (v2.4),PMTCT_HEI_POS,Concept,PEPFAR,MER,PMTCT_HEI_POS,Reference Indicator,FY20,v2.4,Testing,"Number of HIV-infected infants identified in the reporting period, whose diagnostic sample was collected by 12 months of age.","Number of HIV-infected infants identified in the reporting period, whose diagnostic sample was collected by 12 months of age.","This indicator excludes confirmatory testing. It includes 2 required sets of disaggregations: 
1) disaggregation by age for positive infants based on the infant’s age at specimen collection for virologic testing;
2) Confirmation of ART initiation, also disaggregated by age at specimen collection.
",N/A,None,None,Facility,Quarterly,"This indicator measures how many HIV-infected infants are identified in a reporting period, disaggregated by age at sample collection and ART initiation status. Identification is by virologic HIV testing: DNA PCR testing of dried blood spots (DBS) or point of care (POC) (e.g., Alere, Xpert) virologic testing. Infants are defined as a child aged between 0 days (newborn) and 12 months of age, and age disaggregation is based on the infant age at the time of sample collection. The infant age reported should not be based on how old the infant was when the result was available to the site but when the sample was collected.

This indicator can include infants identified as HIV-infected on any virologic test by 12 months of age and is not limited to infants identified as HIV-infected on their first virologic test. Infants may be HIV-uninfected on their first virologic test, but at a later age be identified as HIV-infected, and they should be counted in this indicator as long as they were aged 0 - 12 months at the time of subsequent sample collection. Confirmatory testing (collection of a second sample for repeat virologic testing after the first virologic test is positive) is excluded.

Positive Infants and Linkage to ART: PMTCT_HEI_POS will be used to track how many positive infants are identified in a reporting period, and the “ART initiation confirmed” disaggregate can be compared to PMTCT_HEI_POS positive infants to describe rates of linkage to ART for HIV-infected infants (PMTCT_HEI_POS_ART / PMTCT_HEI_POS). The age disaggregate will also help describe linkage rates for very young infants (0-2mo). The proportion of positive infants confirmed as initiating ART can be used to help identify sites with potential successes or challenges in documentation, linkage, and/or initiation of infected infants.

Comparison to TX_NEW age <1: the disaggregate for PMTCT_HEI_POS infants confirmed as initiating ART (sum of 0-2 and 2-12 months) could be compared to “infants <1-year-old initiated on ART (TX_NEW <1)."" However, equal values for PMTCT_HEI_POS_ART and TX_NEW age <1 may not be expected, as each indicator may not be counting the same infants. The ART initiation disaggregate within HEI_POS will allow us to report a linked infant ART initiation outcome for each positive infant reported. For more information, see section on ""How to review for data quality.""

Proxy positivity: When quarterly time period results are aggregated, PMTCT_HEI_POS (numerator) may be able to be compared to PMTCT_EID (numerator) for a proxy positivity calculation. This comparison will provide a poor proxy for positivity for sites or areas with a high percent of test results that are unknown. Combining quarters of data for both PMTCT_HEI_POS and PMTCT_EID for this comparison may reduce the portion of test
results that are unknown, especially for infants whose sample was collected near the end of a reporting period. It is also important to note that infants reported under HEI_POS will not be exactly the same as infants reported through PMTCT_EID in the quarterly time period for several reasons: 1) PMTCT_EID is limited to first virologic tests whereas HEI_POS reports infants identified on a first or subsequent test 2) PMTCT_EID is limited to infants with a first virologic test sample collected during the reporting period; whereas PMTCT_HEI_POS includes infants whose positive diagnosis was established during the reporting period, but their sample could have been collected in the prior period.

Birth cohort monitoring: HIV status of infants at the end of the breastfeeding period and the outcomes of the PMTCT program are measured in the PMTCT Final Outcome indicator, PMTCT_FO.

This indicator reports HIV-infected infants identified by virologic HIV testing on any sample collected by 12 months of age: DNA PCR testing of dried blood spots (DBS) or point of care (POC) (e.g., Alere, Xpert) virologic testing.

**Limitations and Considerations:**
* This indicator does not collect infants with a negative virologic test result or the number of infants whose test result is unknown. As such, “percent unknown” cannot be calculated through the MER indicator, though it is still an important metric for program monitoring. Notifying caregivers of infant test results remains important.
* The infants reported as tested under the revised PMTCT_EID indicator are not necessarily the same infants whose positive results would be reported under the new HEI_POS indicator. Dividing HEI_POS by PMTCT_EID will not provide a precise measure of positivity; however, a proxy positivity could be calculated over a longer time period. See “How to Review for Data Quality” for more information.

","This indicator should be collected from the clinical source (i.e., HIV-exposed infant registers or patient records) to ensure unduplicated patient counting and patient care. HIV-exposed infant registers should be used to count HIV-infected infants whose results were returned in the reporting period and the age at the time of sample collection. (If available, information could come from electronic systems). If the standard report does not contain all the required information, individual patient files should be used. Additional supporting information for this indicator can be obtained from standard laboratory information systems (i.e., DNA PCR or POC/near POC log books or electronic systems) however, it will be important to ensure that repeat tests of the same sample or HIV-infected infants receiving a confirmatory virologic HIV test result are not counted twice. Please note that PMTCT_HEI_POS should include all HIV-positive infants identified at the facility in the quarter, regardless of entry point (i.e., not just those identified through the PMTCT entry point). Therefore, a PMTCT clinic may need to compile testing data from other entry points at the facility (e.g., inpatient wards, malnutrition program) to report accurately and completely on this indicator.

Only HIV-infected infants identified as infected by a virologic HIV test on a sample collected when they were between ages 0 through 12 months should be included in this indicator.
Infants who initially were identified negative from a first virologic test but who were later identified as HIV-infected after a later virologic test should be included, as long as the infant was still aged 12 months or less at the time of sample collection. Currently, the most commonly used form of virologic testing or nucleic acid testing (“NAT”) is HIV DNA PCR on dried blood spots (DBS) but this indicator also includes HIV-infected infants identified through POC testing (e.g., Alere, Xpert). Serologic testing or “rapid” testing cannot diagnose HIV infection in infant and so infants with a positive serologic test result and either no virologic test result or a negative virologic test result should not be included; however, infants with a positive serologic test and a positive virologic test result should be included.

The numerator is divided into HIV-infected infants who had their diagnostic sample collected for virologic testing between birth and 2 months of age and those whose diagnostic sample was collected between 2 and 12 months of age. The 0- ≤2 month and 2- 12-month time periods are based on **age at sample collection** for virologic HIV testing, not on date of result available to the facility or caregiver. HIV-infected infants should be reported in the quarterly time period in which they are identified, even if the sample was collected/sent in the previous quarter; their age should be reported by age at the time of collection of the sample that produced the positive result, and not the age when the result was available to the site.

**Example scenario to clarify time period and age:** an infant has a DBS collected in quarter 3, aged 11 months. Due to long turnaround times, the positive result returns to the site in quarter 4 and staff now identify him/her as HIV-infected at 13 months old. This infant should be counted in quarter 4 as HIV-infected, and his/her age should be reported as 11 months (2-12mo age band).

**ART initiation:** An additional disaggregate of the numerator is that the HIV positive infant is confirmed as having initiated ART. An HIV-infected infant reported as “ART initiation confirmed” should have documentation of an ART regimen in their record. An HIV-infected infant whose record includes documentation of “referred to ART” or an ART clinic number
without evidence of receipt of an ART regimen should not be reported as “ART initiation confirmed.” ART does not include infant ARV prophylaxis regimens for PMTCT.

","**Linkage and ART Initiation:**
* Compare the PMTCT_HEI_POS ART initiation confirmed (disaggregate) to the PMTCT_ HEI_POS numerator to calculate linkage to ART. Significantly <100% or
>100% linkage of HIV-infected infants to ART may reflect referrals to different sites, program weakness, or poor data quality and requires review to confirm.
* TX_NEW comparison: HEI_POS_ART disaggregate is expected to be close in value to TX_NEW age <1; however, some discrepancies could be expected and significant discrepancies should be reviewed to confirm. These values may differ in part because the age disaggregate definitions for these indicators differs. TX_NEW age is based on age at ART initiation, while PMTCT_HEI_POS is based on age at virologic sample collection. Scenario: An infant’s virologic sample was collected when the infant was 11 months old near the end of Q1. The infant’s positive result was available to the site in Q2 and she started ART in Q2 at 13 months of age. Under PMTCT_HEI_POS in Q2, she would be reported as “Positive, ART initiation confirmed, age 2-12mo;” however, under TX_NEW in Q2 she would be reported in the 1-9-year age group.
**Proxy positivity:** it is useful to review proxy positivity (PMTCT_HEI_POS / PMTCT_EID) across sites or locations to identify potential outliers for further review. Summing multiple
quarters of data is recommended, as quarter-specific comparisons may provide a less accurate proxy. See “How to use” section for more considerations.

",Number of new ANC clients in reporting period,N/A,None,Facility,Quarterly,Track progress toward ensuring that all pregnant women who attend PEPFAR-supported antenatal care (ANC) know their HIV status and those newly testing positive are initiated on ART.,"The data source is the ANC register. There is a risk of double counting as a pregnant woman could be tested multiple times during one pregnancy; therefore, partners should ensure a data collection and reporting system is in place to minimize double counting, including a longitudinal ANC register (meaning a register that is able to record all information about one pregnancy in one location, with rows or columns that allow for recording information on multiple visits during that pregnancy).

Subsequent testing during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be counted in the HTS modality: Post ANC1: Pregnancy/L&D/BF. There is also a risk of undercounting if those women who already knew their HIV status prior to attending ANC are not documented, therefore the ANC register should at a minimum document both “previously known positive” and “newly tested positive”.

It may be appropriate to report “known negative” women under the “Recent Negative” disaggregate if national guidelines do not require retesting women known to be HIV negative (often women tested in the last 3 months, however exact timing depends on local guidelines). See disaggregate definitions below for additional information.

Women reported under the “Newly Tested Positive” and “New Negative” disaggregations will auto-populate the HTS_TST ANC1 modality. Women who are tested later in pregnancy, during L&D, and/or during breastfeeding should be reported under the HTS_TST Post

Numerator: Count all women who were enrolled in ANC during the 12-month reporting period whose HIV status is known positive, or who received an HIV test result (positive or negative) during ANC. Reconcile with all women in the L&D register who whose date of delivery was in the 12 months reporting period and whose HIV status at L&D was known positive, or who received an HIV test result (positive or negative) at ANC or L&D to avoid double counting.

The numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. The number of women with known (positive) HIV infection attending ANC for a new pregnancy over the last reporting period
2. The number of women attending ANC, L&D who were tested for HIV and received results

The numerator can be summed from categories a-d below:

a. Number of pregnant women with unknown HIV status attending ANC who received an HIV test and result during the current pregnancy

b. Pregnant women with known HIV infection attending ANC for a new pregnancy

c.  Number of pregnant women with unknown HIV status attending L&D who received an HIV test and result during their current pregnancy

d. Women with unknown HIV status attending postpartum services within 72 hours of delivery who were tested for the first time in the current pregnancy and received results.

A “status” is defined as a confirmed test result from a test during this pregnancy (either positive or negative) or already known HIV infection at antenatal clinic entry. An indeterminate test result should not be counted or reported as a part of this indicator.
For the denominator: Count all women who were enrolled in ANC during the 12-month reporting period OR delivered at the facility (recorded in the L&D register), reconciling the latter with the former using the ANC No. to avoid double counting.

As per global guidance (see GARPR link above), it is expected that the national program can reconcile information collected from ANC with L&D records. However, in MER 2.0 the PEPFAR indicator for PMTCT_ART has been simplified to collect information only at antenatal care (ANC) sites to better align with 2016 WHO Consolidated ARV guidelines, reduce burden on data collection, and improve data quality. Therefore, in reporting this indicator PEPFAR operating units should 1) utilize the national system whether it is able avoid double counting or not and are not expected to collect or report this information through a separate system 2) if it this is not possible to report individuals from both ANC and L&D, please include an explanation in the narrative whether the data is from ANC, L&D and/or both.

Pregnant women’s HIV status should be counted only once per pregnancy. This may be difficult if national guidelines recommend testing a pregnant woman more than once during a pregnancy or if a woman seroconverts during her pregnancy and has multiple tests.

It may also help inform coverage of PEPFAR- supported programming for priority populations when reliable population size estimates are available.

**Priority populations:** Priority populations should be defined by each country in the indicator narrative and must have a documented HIV prevalence or incidence greater than the general population of the country. Groups that might be counted as priority populations include:
* Adolescent girls and young women (determined using the reported age/sex disaggregations)
* Adolescent boys and young men (determined using the reported age/sex disaggregations)
* Adult men (determined using the reported age/sex disaggregations)
* Clients of sex workers
* Displaced persons
* Fishing Communities
* Military and other uniformed services
* Mobile Populations
* Non-injecting drug users

**Package of interventions:** Together with the IP, the country team designs a set of interventions for each of the priority populations. In a defined catchment area for the specific priority population, all prevention interventions may not be offered by one IP. However, all required intervention must be available in the catchment area for the priority population. Interventions must adhere to written protocols, include goals and activities, and be designed to promote adoption of key behaviors that support HIV prevention and service uptake among the priority  population(s). The interventions should comprise multiple encounters with the same individuals or groups.

**Children aged 9-14 who are receiving an approved primary prevention of HIV and sexual violence intervention should be reported under OVC_SERV and not PP_PREV. Please see the OVC_SERV reference sheet for further detail.**

HIV testing services (HTS) or screening/referring an individual to HTS is required to be offered (at least once during the reporting period and/or in accordance with WHO/national guidance) unless the individual had previously been tested positive for HIV. If the individual is self-identified as HIV positive, then HTS screening or referral to HTS will not be a required element of this indicator.

Conducting risk assessments or screening to determine the need for HIV testing also meets the HTS component of PP_PREV. For example, if there is a ten-year-old girl enrolled in DREAMS, we would anticipate that she would not need to be tested for HIV if a risk assessment determines that she is not sexually active, and she does not have any additional risk factors for HIV.

The table below lists the interventions that must be offered in addition to HTS (or HTS screening/referral).

**Required Interventions for Adult Populations:**
* Promotion of relevant prevention and clinical services and demand creation to increase awareness, acceptability, and uptake of these services.
* Information, education, and skills development to: reduce HIV risk and vulnerability; correctly identify HIV prevention methods; adopt and sustain positive behavior change; and promote gender equity and supportive norms and stigma reduction.
* HTS screening or referral to HIV testing services; facilitated linkage to care and prevention services; and/or support services to promote use of, retention in, and adherence to care.
* Condom and lubricant (where feasible) promotion, skills building, and facilitated access to condoms and lubricant (where feasible) through direct provision or linkages to social marketing and/or other service outlets.

**Required Interventions for Youth Populations:**
* Promotion of relevant youth-friendly prevention and clinical services and demand creation to increase awareness, acceptability, and uptake of these services.
* Information, education and skills development to: reduce HIV risk and vulnerability; correctly identify HIV prevention methods; adopt and sustain positive behavior change; and promote gender equity and supportive norms and stigma reduction.
* HTS screening or referral to HIV testing services; facilitated linkage to care and prevention services; and/or support services to promote use of, retention in, and adherence to care.
* Condom and lubricant (where feasible) promotion, skills training, and facilitated access to condoms and lubricant (where feasible) through direct provision or linkages to social marketing and/or other youth- friendly, community-based service outlets.
* Programs targeting adults to raise awareness of HIV risks for young people, promote positive parenting and mentoring practices, and effective adult-child communication about sexuality and sexual risk reduction.
","Data collection requires reliable tracking systems that are designed to count the number of one-on-one encounters or participation in group interventions and that reduce double- counting of individuals in a reporting period. Data should be collected at every encounter/point of service and aggregated in time for PEPFAR reporting cycles. This indicator only counts those interventions at the individual and/or group level.

A partner may count an individual (with unknown HIV serostatus or self-identified as HIV negative) as having received a prevention intervention if they have provided HTS and/or HTS screening and/or referral to HTS **AND** at least one of the other listed prevention interventions during the reporting period. If an individual is already known to be HIV positive at the time of service delivery, s/he should receive at least one of the interventions listed in the table (outside of HTS) to qualify as being counted under this indicator.

Tracking systems must be able to reduce double-counting of individuals in a reporting period. **An individual will be reported when he/she first receives any of the required interventions in the reporting period; if the same individual receives any subsequent interventions during the same reporting period they will be reported as a returning beneficiary and not counted again in the reporting period.**

Furthermore, **de-duplication of all returning beneficiaries within the Q3-Q4 reporting period (April 1 – September 30) will also need to take place in Q4 reporting if they had already been counted under PP_PREV in Q1-Q2 of the same fiscal year.** For example, if an individual had received prevention interventions under PP_PREV through PEPFAR- supported program in January 2017 and was counted as being reached in FY17 Q2 reporting cycle, and this same individual was later reached with prevention services again by PEPFAR-supported program in June 2017, that individual should **NOT** be reported again in the FY17 Q4 reporting period. This de-duplication is critical to accurately track the **ANNUAL** number of unique individuals reached by PEPFAR within a given fiscal year.

Trend analysis of past performance PP_PREV data will be adversely affected with the change in frequency of PP_PREV reporting from annually to semi-annually if this de- duplication is ignored (i.e., annual number of PP_PREV reported within the same fiscal year would be inflated as the same individual would be counted twice if this de-duplication does not occur at Q4 reporting).

If possible, a unique identifier should be assigned to program participants or names can be collected to track individual participation in the prevention interventions/sites.

Site (facility and community) level system should maintain accurate registers for each individual priority population and sum these individual populations when reporting this indicator.","Data should be reviewed regularly for the purposes of program management, to monitor progress towards achieving targets, and to identify and correct any data quality issues.

HIV-positive test results should be verified, if possible, for all persons accessing HIV prevention services during the reporting period. Implementing partners should maintain records (without persoally identifiable information) on whether the HIV-positive client is linked to treatment. Patients tested positive in previous reporting periods should be counted as Known Positives.
* **Newly Tested and/or Referred for Testing:** Persons within each priority population type for whom HIV testing is indicated because they do not know their HIV status or their last HIV-negative test was more than 3-6 months ago (or more/less frequently as indicated by Natioal Guidelines) should either be offered an HIV test on site or given information about where and when they can access an HIV test at another nearby clinic. Every attempt should be made to ensure the client is linked with HIV testing services that are PP-friendly, and where possible the completed referral should be documented (i.e., the client accessed HIV testing). Note: Persons who access testing and whose results are newly tested HIV-positive in the reporting period should also be counted under ""newly tested"" even if they return for additional prevention services during that reporting period.
* **Declined Testing and/or Referral:** Persons who, after explaining the benefits of HIV testing and the reason for testing every 3-6 months (or more/less frequently as indicated by National Guidelines), decline to be tested on-site or referred to a site where HIV testing is offered. Although every attempt should be made to support priority populations with HIV testing as part of the package of HIV prevention services and to provide HIV testing on site or PP-friendly sites, programs should also respect the autonomy of clients to decline this service. Clients who decline testing and/or referral can still receive other prevention service, if the benefits of HIV testing were explained and testing or a referral for testing was offered.
* **Test not required based on risk assessment:** Persons who, based on screening or a risk assessment, do not require a test for HIV during the reporting period.

WHO guidelines recommend offering oral PrEP to those at substantial risk of HIV infection, (incidence rate of 3 per 100 persons per year). This level of elevated risk has been seen among serodiscordant couples with inconsistent condom use when the partner living with HIV is not virally suppressed, men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people (TG), sex workers (SW) of all genders, and people who inject drugs (PWID), as well as adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. PEPFAR supports WHO guidelines on the use of PrEP as part of a package of comprehensive structural, biomedical and behavioral prevention services. In most settings, PrEP will be integrated into existing prevention or treatment services for the target population.

As PEPFAR continues to scale up PrEP service delivery, monitoring the PrEP cascade will be important to understand which populations are using this prevention intervention, as well as their length of time using it and their HIV outcome. Understanding the PrEP cascade by population will help improve implementation strategies for those in highest incidence communities initiating PrEP and the retention strategies to support them to stay on PrEP.","The numerator can be generated by counting the number of individuals that have received PrEP during the reporting period, in accordance with national guidelines or WHO standards, including both those individuals newly initiating on PrEP and those continuing to receive PrEP. PREP_CURR reflects all persons receiving PrEP during the reporting period.

* An individual newly initiating on PrEP will be counted under both PrEP_NEW and PREP_CURR during the reporting period.
* Unlike TX_CURR, PrEP_CURR counts the number of individuals that received PrEP **at ANY point during the reporting period,** so the client does not have to be active on PrEP on the last day of the reporting period like TX_CURR. Unlike HIV treatment, a client does not have to remain on PrEP for the duration of their life. Use of PrEP may cease once an individual is no longer at risk for HIV. This indicator intends to measure client demand for PrEP at any point within the reporting period.
    * At Q2: report the number of unique individuals that received PrEP in Q1 and Q2. At Q4: report the number of unique individuals that received PrEP in at any point within the fiscal year (i.e., Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4).
* If an individual tests positive at his or her three-month PrEP follow-up appointment and is then initiated on PEPFAR-supported treatment in the same reporting period, that individual could be counted as PREP_CURR in addition to TX_NEW and TX_CURR (given successful transfer into the ART program) within that reporting period. They would not be counted under PREP_CURR in subsequent reporting periods.
* The reporting level for this indicator is the facility level only. If PrEP is being provided at community-based sites, these sites should be connected to or have a relationship to a clinical facility. The community sites providing PrEP programming should count the number of individuals currently on PrEP being served through the community service delivery point, and then those data should be reported through the facility connected to that community site.

**Key Populations (KPs):**
Reporting of the key population disaggregation should be consistent with what is described under the KP_PREV “How to review for data quality” section on mutual exclusivity of an individual who falls under multiple KP categories (e.g., FSW who injects drugs). In such instances, the individual should only be reported in ONE KP disaggregation category with which this person is most identified. See **Appendix A** to support the identification of key populations at service delivery.

The first priority of data collection and reporting of PrEP among key populations must be to **do no harm**. These data must be managed confidentially to ensure the identities of individuals are protected and to prevent further stigma and discrimination of key populations.

NOTE: In accordance with PrEP guidance, not all PrEP beneficiaries are expected to fall within the KP disaggregates, therefore the total disaggregations for KP does not have to sum to the numerator total.

This indicator permits monitoring trends in PrEP use but does not attempt to distinguish between different modes or regimens of PrEP or to measure the cost, quality, or effectiveness of PrEP provided. These will each vary within and between countries and are liable to change over time.

PrEP has been shown to reduce incident infections among several populations including serodiscordant heterosexual couples, MSM, FSW, and transgender people (TG).

NEW is a state defined by an individual’s beginning in a PrEP program. It is expected that the characteristics of new clients are recorded at the time they newly initiate into a program.

Similarly, data from this indicator can be used with forecasting data to illustrate that either sufficient stock are available for future or an upcoming need by ARV category exists.

Data from SC_CURR can be used in many ways, such as: 
(1) to justify a change in the supply plan (i.e., if one ARV drug category is overstocked while another is understocked),
(2) to illustrate if a ARV drug category is not being dispensed as anticipated, 
(3) to determine if an ARV drug category is overstocked, 
(4) to determine where ARVs may be overstocked, 
(5) to identify bottlenecks or sites where stock is available and, when coupled with SC_ARVDISP, not dispensed. Data can also be used to examine the relationship between facilities dispensing to patients and sites providing ARVs to dispensing sites (i.e., warehouses) to determine if quantities held at any site are reasonable.
","This indicator should be collected from facility dispensing registers or stock records, reported at the site level, based on data available to the facility-based implementing partner, but could include host government-supported Warehouse or Logistics Management Information System(s) (LMIS) as well. Operational Units (OUs) should work with IPs supporting facilities and/or the supply chain IPs to access facility dispensing registers or the LMIS to consolidate dispensing data by site and ARV category for reporting.

Data should be reported, as indicated, in the categories below:

* TLD 30-count bottles 
* TLD 90-count bottles 
* TLD 180-count bottles 
* TLE/400 30-count bottles 
* TLE/400 90-count bottles

* LPV/r 40/10 (pediatric) bottles 
* NVP (adult) bottles
* NVP (pediatric), (not including NVP 10) bottles 
* Other (adult) bottles
* Other (pediatric) bottles

This indicator should be used to describe any anticipated stock-outs, ARV gaps, or are unable to extend their treatment coverage due to supply constraints. In addition, programs should utilize monthly data on each ARV drug category, when available, especially if those data are collected for donor organization and collaboration (such as the PPMR-HIV or SC- FACT).

*	For clarity, the APR calculation for TB_PREV was changed from a snapshot indicator, to being summed over time (i.e., previous calculation: APR=Q4, new calculation: APR=Q2+Q4).",Facility,Semi-Annually,"This indicator measures the performance of HIV programs in scaling up TPT, with the goal of preventing progression to active TB disease among PLHIV and decreasing ongoing TB transmission in this population.

As part of a cascade from TX_CURR to TB screening (captured in TX_TB), this indicator will inform programs on the pace of scale-up, and the proportion will allow for monitoring of cohorts through completion of therapy.

Disaggregates on the timing of ART and age/sex breakdowns will allow programs to monitor those who are newly starting ART, an important focal population in all countries and in particular in countries that have already provided TPT for many of their PLHIV in care.","The denominator can be generated by counting the total number of patients who initiated any regimen of TPT in the semiannual reporting period that is prior to the one being reported on. For example, if reporting is for Q1 and Q2 of a fiscal year (e.g., October 2019 to March 2020), then the denominator would include those that were started on TPT in Q3 and Q4 of the previous fiscal year (e.g., April to September 2019). If a TPT register is being used, then this would require simply framing out the dates that define the previous reporting period and counting all those who started TPT. 

**Importantly, programs should ensure that patients on continuous isoniazid therapy are counted only once, when they initiate therapy (denominator) and after they complete the first six months (numerator); care should be taken to ensure they are not included in future calculations.** 

If a patient is initiated on TPT and dies before TPT completion, this patient should be recorded in the denominator, but not in the numerator. If a patient initiates TPT at one site, completes at another, and is a documented transfer, that patient should be recorded in the numerator at the site where they initiated TPT, and they should be recorded as completed TPT (numerator) at the new site. 

The numerator can be generated by counting the subset of patients from the denominator who received at least six months of IPT or have completed another standard course of TPT. If a TPT register is being used, this would require framing out the dates that define the previous reporting period, identifying those that initiated TPT during the reporting period (the denominator) and then documenting the number of those patients who completed the course of TPT that they started during that reporting period. This should include the patients who completed a shorter alternative course, such as 3-HP, as well as those who are on prolonged or continuous IPT who have completed their first six months of therapy. 

Note: If a patient was started on IPT in the previous reporting period (e.g., Q3 or Q4 FY2019), he/she would have completed during the current reporting period (e.g., Q1 or Q2 FY2020). 

**For IPT:** 
* All patients who started any form of IPT, including prolonged or continuous IPT, at any time in the previous 6-month reporting period (i.e., at any time in the 6 months before the start of the period being reported) should be included in the denominator. Among the denominator, those that completed at least six months of isoniazid therapy would have done so in the period currently being reported (the numerator). The few patients who started and completed IPT in the previous reporting should be included and counted. 

**For 3-HP:** 
* Patients who are taking 3-HP may have initiated and completed therapy in the previous reporting period, or they may have initiated TPT in the previous reporting period and completed TPT in the period currently being reported. 
* Any patient who started 3-HP at any point in the previous reporting period would be included in the denominator. 
* Any patient from that denominator who completed the course would be included in the numerator; this would include those who completed 3-HP in the first 3 months of the period being reported on. 

**For alternative regimens:** 
* Patients who are taking other regimens (such as 1-HP) may also have initiated and completed therapy in the previous reporting period or they may have initiated TPT in the previous reporting period and completed TPT in the period currently being reported. Include and count patients under both scenarios (start and completion in the same reporting period AND start in the previous reporting period but completion in the one currently being reported). 

These data elements can be collected from the ART register or from separate TPT registers. In some countries, TB presumptive registers might contain this information as well, but the information will need to be cross referenced for ART status.",Data Element ≥ subtotal of each of the disaggregations.,"The TB_PREV denominator and numerator should be analyzed independently of other data and the results reported in Q2 and Q4 should be summed to calculate the total number of ART patients who initiated and completed a course of TPT.

When analyzing this data in conjunction with data on TB screening for ART patients (TX_TB), it is important to align the correct reporting periods. For example, TB_PREV captures those who were initiated on TPT during the **previous** reporting period, so it should be compared to TB screening (TX_TB Denominator) and TX_CURR data from the previous reporting period.","**Age/Sex by ART Start: [Required]**

Importantly, _**patients who have not received ARVs within four weeks (i.e., 28 days) of their last missed drug pick-up should not be counted.**_

_The following should also be considered:_

* Patients on ART who initiated or transferred-in during the reporting period should be counted.

* Patients that pick up 3 or more months of anti-retroviral drugs at one visit (i.e., multi- month dispensation) should also be counted as long as they have received enough ARVs to last to the end of the reporting period at a minimum.

* However, if it is determined that a patient has died, they should immediately be removed from the TX_CURR results.

* HIV-positive pregnant women who are eligible for and are receiving antiretroviral drugs for their own treatment should be counted. HIV-positive pregnant women initiating lifelong ART through PMTCT (Option B+) will count as “current” on ART under this indicator. These include HIV-infected pregnant women who:
    * Have newly initiated ART during the current pregnancy
    * Are already on ART at the beginning of the current pregnancy

Patients excluded from the current on ART count are patients who died, stopped treatment, transferred out, or are lost to follow-up. _**Patients who have not received ARVs within four weeks (i.e., 28 days) of their last missed drug pick-up should not be counted.**_ Patients do not need to qualify as lost to follow-up before tracing efforts commence. Efforts to trace patients that have missed a clinical visit or drug pick-up should begin immediately following a missed clinical contact.

Patients who have not received ARVs within four weeks of their last missed drug pick-up should be described further in the reporting of the TX_ML indicator. Patients that restart treatment after four weeks or more of being off ARVs should also be counted under TX_RTT in the reporting period in which the patient returns to care and restarts ARVs.

TX_CURR should be reported from both PEPFAR-supported sites in the private and/or public sector. Patients currently receiving treatment from mobile clinics can be reported in two ways. Firstly, if the mobile clinic is associated with (e.g., receives commodities, reports to, is staffed by) a nearby health facility, then these individuals should be reported by that facility. Secondly, if a mobile clinic is stationary for more than 2 reporting periods, it should be added to the PEPFAR facility list with geocodes and data should be reported for this mobile clinic directly.

**DO NOT include:** Patients who receive ARVs for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) or short-term ART only for prevention (PrEP) should not be reported in this indicator.

**Key Populations (KPs):**
Both KP-specific and clinical partners should complete these KP disaggregations, but only if safe to maintain these files and to report. Reporting of the key population disaggregation should be consistent with what is described under the KP_PREV “How to review for data quality” section on mutual exclusivity of an individual who falls under multiple KP categories (e.g., FSW who injects drugs). In such instances, the individual should only be reported in ONE KP disaggregation category with which this person is most identified. See Appendix A to support the identification of key populations at service delivery.

CURRENT is a state defined by treatment status when last seen, so it is expected that characteristics of these clients would be updated each time they are seen by a program. Age represents an individual’s age at the end of the reporting period or when last seen at the facility. For example, a 14-year-old child will be counted as currently receiving treatment in the <15 age category at the end of reporting period “A”. During reporting period “B” the child turns age 15 and so at the end of this reporting period the child will be counted under the 15+ age category.

Antiretroviral therapy has been shown to reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality among those living with HIV, and onward HIV transmission. Studies have also shown that early initiation, regardless of an individual’s CD4 cell count, can enhance treatment benefits and save lives, and WHO currently recommends treatment for all. The percentage of adults and children receiving antiretroviral therapy among all adults and children living with HIV provides a benchmark for monitoring global targets over time and comparing progress across countries. It is one of the 10 global indicators in WHO’s 2015 Consolidated strategic information guidelines for HIV in the health sector.

This indicator is harmonized with GAM indicator “[People living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy.](http://www.indicatorregistry.org/indicator/people-living-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy)” However, the LTFU definition change is still being harmonized across all multilateral HIV organizations.

**Given the shift in the definition of LTFU, it’s imperative that country teams use the host country indicator narrative to describe what definition is being used for TX_CURR reporting. Does the host country result assume a LTFU definition of <28 days or <90 days?**","This indicator measures the progress towards providing antiretroviral therapy to all people living with HIV. The data source for this indicator is ART program monitoring tools, such as ART patient registers, pharmacy dispensing records, and summary reporting forms.

The number of adults and children receiving treatment can be obtained through data from facility- based antiretroviral therapy registers or drug supply management systems. Data should be collected continuously and aggregated on a monthly or quarterly basis to obtain subnational and national totals. The most recent full year of data should be used for annual reporting. Data should be collected from health facility recording and reporting forms, program data, health information system.

This indicator can be generated by counting the number of adults and children receiving antiretroviral therapy at the end of the reporting period. This value should equal the number of adults and children who have ever started antiretroviral therapy minus those not currently on treatment prior to the end of the reporting period. This will exclude those who died, stopped treatment or were lost to follow-up during the year.

Some people pick up several months of antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) at one visit, which could cover the last months of the reporting period. Efforts should be made to include these people in the numerator as receiving antiretrovirals even if they do not attend the clinic in the last month of the reporting period.

When disaggregating the numerator by age, people receiving antiretroviral therapy should be reported in the relevant age category based on their age at the end of the reporting year. HIV- positive pregnant women who are on antiretroviral therapy should be included in the numerator.

* Outcome disaggregations simplified to the following categories: died, lost to follow-up (LTFU), transferred out, and refused (stopped) treatment.
* Sub-disaggregation added to the LTFU outcome for patients LTFU after being on treatment for >3 months vs. patients LTFU after being on treatment <3 months. This distinction was added to highlight the critical nature of early retention for successful longer-term retention among those persons newly initiating ART, especially otherwise healthy or younger adults.
",Facility,Quarterly,"TX_ML (treatment mortality and lost to follow up) is intended to: (1) help better understand fluctuations or steady growth in TX_CURR over time, (2) encourage tracing of patients when a patient has had no clinical contact for greater than 28 days since their last expected contact and (3) promote timely identification of patient outcomes among patients known to have missed clinical visits or drug pickups. PEPFAR implementing partners must ensure that immediate programmatic action is being taken to locate patients that have had no clinical contact for greater than 28 days since their last expected clinical contact. Serious and repeated attempts should be made to reengage any such patients and return them to treatment. In case of death, mortality data should be analyzed and investigated to determine causes of death, where possible.

From a public health perspective, treatment adherence and retention are essential to achieve and maintain viral suppression and ultimately reduce or eliminate disease transmission. Not uncommonly, patients who are lost-to-follow up, may have died or have self-transferred to another health care facility; as such, it is important to understand and make these distinctions as each one may require different programmatic interventions.

Serious attempts should be made to reengage any patient that has not returned for clinical services or drug pick-up and return them to treatment, and mortality data should be analyzed and investigated to determine causes of death amenable to programmatic intervention (e.g., TB, opportunistic infection, cervical cancer).

It is important to note that this is not a cohort monitoring indicator. TX_ML is meant to be
used in conjunction with TX_CURR to help better understand fluctuations or steady growth of the ART patient population.
","This indicator should not count or report those patients who were already lost and not counted in TX_CURR at the beginning of the reporting period.

Clinical contact is defined as reporting to the clinic for ART pick-up or clinical assessment, or a documented community visit with a community health worker or peer from an ART refill group. Attempts to reach and re-engage patients into treatment should be made as soon as a patient misses a clinical visit.

When a patient has missed their most recent expected clinical contact, the clinic or other related staff should attempt to reach and reengage the patient as soon as possible. Once a PLHIV has reached 28 days past their expected clinical contact or drug pick-up, s/he should be removed from TX_CURR, the clinic should again attempt to reach and re-engage the patient, and his/her current outcome should be determined. The outcomes are defined as not currently on ART at the facility if the patient:
1. Died
2. Lost to follow-up
    a. On treatment for <3 months when LTFU
    b. On treatment for >3 months when LTFU
3. Transferred out
4. Refused (stopped) treatment

See Disaggregates and Descriptions section below for definitions of each of these outcomes.

If the patient is re-engaged and restarted ART after >28 days of being off treatment, then the patient should be counted in **TX_RTT** in the reporting period and added back to **TX_CURR**, but should not be counted in TX_ML.

Included in the classification of LTFU are the following: patients for whom tracing is not attempted, and patients for whom tracing is attempted but unsuccessful or for whom status cannot otherwise be determined (i.e., patient may have died or may have silently transferred, but status is unknown). A facility may wish to further distinguish these classifications, but they are not required for MER reporting. It is assumed that tracing will be attempted for every patient who has missed clinical visits at both <28 days and >28 days since the last expected clinical contact or ARV pick-up.

This indicator seeks to reconcile the status of patients who are TX_CURR during the reporting period and then fall off of ART, i.e., into the classification of >28 day since clinical contact or ARV pick-up status DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. This includes those ART patients who continue treatment from the prior reporting period (TX_CURR at the beginning of the reporting period), those who newly initiate in this reporting period (TX_NEW), and those who return to care or restart in this reporting period (TX_RTT). To reiterate, this indicator should not count or report those patients who were already lost and not counted in TX_CURR at the beginning of the reporting period.

Facilities should make every attempt to continue to contact persons LTFU from a prior reporting period and return them to care, an outcome which would be reflected in the TX_RTT indicator.

It is widely acknowledged that even where reporting is required, mortality data, especially cause of death, are often underreported or inaccurate. In addition, it may take some time for a clinic to discover that a patient has died. Thus, a clinic may classify a patient as TX_ML_LTFU in the quarter the patient gets to >28 days past the expected clinical contact, but later discover that the patient died. **If it is later discovered that the patient died, they do not need to be recounted or reclassified in this indicator in a later quarter.** Data on deaths should only be reported, if available, in the quarter when the patient gets to >28 days past the expected clinical contact.

Program data available on deaths and the cause of death disaggregate under this indicator should be triangulated with mortality surveillance, where available, to understand causes of death among PLHIV. For more information on routine mortality monitoring, refer to **Appendix H**.

","Patient trackers, tracing logs, missed appointment reports, and other available sources should be routinely checked. These comparisons will help programs understand where efforts are required to better improve and/or ensure completeness of reporting.",There should be no annual total. Data for this indicator are intended to provide context for TX_CURR results but the numerator should **NOT** be summed across reporting periods due to the active movement and potential reclassification of patients.,"**Disaggregate Groups and Disaggregates**

",N/A,"**Outcome definitions:**
* **Died:** Patient was confirmed as dead by direct observation or by unambiguous report of family or close contact (neighbors, co-workers, etc.); it should not be presumed.
* ** Lost to Follow Up:** Patient status has not or cannot be assessed (did not attempt to trace or traced but unable to locate). Regardless of whether the patient was on treatment for < 3 months or greater than 3 months, LTFU is defined as:
    * Traced patient (unable to locate): Exhaustive attempts (e.g., phone calls, home visits, triangulation with other health facilities) were made to locate the patient, but patient was still not located through these efforts. Exhaustive attempts means completing more than 3 attempts to contact or locate the patient using multiple methods.
    * Did not attempt to trace patient: No attempt was made to trace the patient during the reporting period.
* **Transferred Out:** Patient was confirmed to be successfully transferred to another health facility during the reporting period, this includes both “silent transfers” and “down-referrals.” A ‘down-referral’ refers to those instances where a patient is initiated at one facility (counted as TX_NEW and possibly TX_CURR at the initiating facility) and then transferred to a lower level facility for ongoing ART. “Silent transfer” refers to those clients that are lost to treatment at one facility, but have re- entered treatment at another facility without notifying the original departing facility. Through active tracing, the originating facility may learn that a patient has silently transferred.
* **Refused (Stopped) ART:** Patient was contacted and confirmed to have stopped ART during this reporting period. Reasons that the patient stopped ART should be investigated and well documented in the narratives for this indicator (e.g., stigma and discrimination, faith healing, etc.).

This indicator was originally introduced in FY19 and marked the first time PEPFAR collected mortality information through routine program data. Mortality is an essential measure to assess the impact of the health sector more broadly, and the HIV program in particular. Mortality data should be compared between sites and districts as well as by age and sex to determine the geographic and demographic areas where intensified interventions are most needed. Particularly, determining the cause-of-death (COD) or conditions experienced at the time of death among PLHIV can be used to help identify programmatic gaps and focus resources on interventions aimed at reducing preventable deaths.

**Appendix I** describes the ICD codes associated with the cause of death categories outlined below.

**Cause of death definitions:**
* HIV disease resulting in TB: Any patient with known or presumed TB (pulmonary and/or extra-pulmonary) at the time of death without another identified COD
* HIV disease resulting in other infectious and parasitic disease: Any patient who died from any infectious cause other than TB; this includes infections not otherwise specified
* HIV disease resulting in cancer: Any patient with known or presumed cancer at the time of death
* Other HIV disease, resulting in other diseases or conditions leading to death: Any patient who died from a non-infectious, non-malignant cause that was related to HIV, such as acute HIV infection syndrome, (persistent) generalized lymphadenopathy, hematological and immunological abnormalities, etc.
* Other natural causes: Any patient who died from natural causes (including certain cancers and infections, etc.) that were not directly related to HIV disease.
* Non-natural causes: Any patient who died from non-natural causes (e.g., trauma, accident, suicide, war, etc.)
* Unknown Cause: Patients in whom cause of death was truly not known

This measure is critical to monitor along with number of patients currently on ART in relation to the number of PLHIV that are estimated to be eligible for treatment to assess progress in the program’s response to the epidemic in specific geographic areas and populations as well as at the national level. This is particularly critical in the context of current revisions to country- specific ART eligibility.

Reporting the number of new patients enrolled on ART at both the national and overall PEPFAR program levels is critical to monitoring the HIV services cascade, specifically the successful linkage between HIV diagnosis and initiating ART.

Disaggregation of new on ART by age/sex at ART initiation, and breastfeeding status at ART initiation is important to understand the percentage of new ART initiations coming from priority populations. Note that pregnancy status at ART initiation is captured in the
PMTCT_ART indicator.

* Patients who have been off treatment from >28 days and restart ART should be counted in TX_RTT. They should not be counted in TX_NEW.

* **NEW is a state defined by an individual initiating ART during the reporting period.

HIV-positive pregnant women who are eligible for and are newly receiving antiretroviral drugs for their own treatment are included in TX_NEW. HIV-positive pregnant women initiating lifelong ART through PMTCT (Option B+) will count as “current” on ART under TX_CURR.

BF disaggregation: Women who initiate ART while breastfeeding should be counted under this indicator but not in PMTCT_ART.

**Key Populations (KPs):**

Both KP-specific and clinical partners should complete these KP disaggregations, but only if safe to maintain these files and to report. Reporting of the key population disaggregation should be consistent with what is described under the KP_PREV “How to review for data quality” section on mutual exclusivity of an individual who falls under multiple KP categories (e.g., FSW who injects drugs). In such instances, the individual should only be reported in ONE KP disaggregation category with which this person is most identified.

This indicator monitors the proportion of documented viral load results from adult and pediatric ART patients who have been on ART for at least 3 months (or according to national guidelines) with a suppressed result (<1,000 copies/ml). This allows ART programs to monitor individual and overall programmatic response to ART as measured by virologic suppression. This indicator will provide data on patients who have a viral load (VL) test in the past 12 months and the percentage who were virally suppressed at the most recent test.

**VL TESTING COVERAGE:**
Comparison of the denominator for this indicator with the result for TX_CURR from 6 months earlier (i.e., two quarters prior) can be used to crudely estimate VL testing coverage supported by PEPFAR. For example, a comparison may be made between the FY20 Q1 denominator for TX_PVLS and FY19 Q3 TX_CURR, given that patients newly initiating ART and included in TX_CURR in FY19 Q4 and FY20 Q1 may not be eligible for a viral load test. In calculating this estimate, it is important to ensure that individuals, not tests are being reported for TX_PVLS.

Analyzing both VL testing coverage and suppression rates by geography, sub-population, and implementing mechanisms is essential for program management and quality of care.
Real-time review of VL results should trigger an immediate response to follow-up on patients who are not suppressed (i.e., VL ≥1000).
","This indicator should be collected from clinical sources (e.g., electronic or paper patient records), where possible, to ensure de-duplicated patient counting and receipt of results to inform patient care. Ideally, data for this indicator should be collected from an electronic medical records system (EMR) to minimize data collection errors and ensure that results are informing patient care. If data collection from an EMR is not possible, indicator data may be collected from paper-based registers or reports that reflect the VL results. If standard patient registers do not contain all the required information, individual patient records should be reviewed.

If a clinical source does not exist or does not contain the desired information, data may be extracted from an electronic laboratory information system (LIS). VL results from an LIS must be linked to back to the individual patients and their record at sites.
NOTE: If patient-linked VL results from LIS is used for reporting, it is incumbent that the implementing partner ensure this information is transcribed into the patient record for timely VL results utilization/patient management.

The data source used for reporting on this indicator should be specified and data reported should be de-duplicated and used to inform patient care at sites. If the LIS is used, please explain why clinical sources could not be used to report on this indicator in the narrative (see guiding narrative question section below).

**VL results should be reported for patients who have been on ART for at least 3 months (or according to national guidelines).** It is important to ensure that the data sources used to collect and aggregate data are updated to be able to report VL results data for patients who have been on ART for at least 3 months.

Beginning in FY19, this indicator moved from annual to quarterly collection. The reporting period still covers a 12-month period and may include data from the previous fiscal year (see visual below). For example, when reporting data in FY20 Q1, country teams will be required to report data for FY19 Q2+ FY19 Q3+FY19 Q4+ FY20 Q1.

Both only VL tests with recorded results and VL results that are linked back to patients should be included in the numerator and denominator of this indicator. This indicator should be reported for all PEPFAR-supported treatment sites (i.e., from all reporting TX_CURR).
VL monitoring result utilization should be promoted for individual patient, site, and program use. If a PEPFAR-supported treatment site (i.e., a site that has reported TX_CURR) has not collected any samples for VL testing, “0” should be entered for both the numerator and denominator.

**Where more than one result is available for the reporting period, the most recent result should be reported.** Programs should describe the method(s) of data collection and the results de-duplication methodology utilized in their narratives.

**Key Populations (KPs):**
Both KP-specific and clinical partners should complete these KP disaggregations, but only if safe to maintain these files and to report. Reporting of the key population disaggregation should be consistent with what is described under the KP_PREV “How to review for data quality” section on mutual exclusivity of an individual who falls under multiple KP categories (e.g., FSW who injects drugs). In such instances, the individual should only be reported in ONE KP disaggregation category with which this person is most identified. See **Appendix A** to support the identification of key populations at service delivery.

The first priority of data collection and reporting of treatment among key populations must be to **do no harm**. These data must be managed confidentially to ensure the identities of individuals are protected and to prevent further stigma and discrimination of key populations.

Monitoring this indicator may also help to identify those PLHIV who were diagnosed and started ART in the past but have been lost to the health care system.

This indicator seeks to encourage ongoing contact with patients who miss appointments and/or to encourage supportive services to facilitate restarting ARV therapy. It also seeks to encourage identification and the return to treatment of those PLHIV with a history of ART but are currently lost or unknown to the health care system.

National clinical guidelines typically recommend that patients with ART history are restarted on ARVs, rather than newly initiate clients as if they were treatment-naïve. Nonetheless, many clinics – lacking sufficient clinical history or documentation – newly initiate patients with prior ART history.

From a public health perspective, treatment adherence and retention are essential to achieve and maintain viral suppression and ultimately reduce or eliminate disease transmission. Serious attempts should be made to reengage and return to treatment any patient that has not returned for clinical services or drug pick-up.
","When a patient has missed their most recent expected clinical contact, the clinic or other related staff should attempt to reach and reengage the patient as soon as possible.

A patient is counted under TX_RTT in the reporting period in which s/he returns to care and restarts ARVs. As with TX_NEW, the TX_RTT patient joins the TX_CURR population; if the patient remains on ART to the end of the reporting period, the patient should be counted as TX_CURR in that reporting period.

A patient should not to be counted as TX_RTT if they have been traced and returned to treatment within 28 days of the last expected contact (clinical or ARV pick up).

_Clinical contact is defined as reporting to the clinic for ART pick-up or clinical assessment, or a documented community visit with a community health worker or peer from an ART refill group._

This includes newly enrolling ART patients as well as those previously started on ART.

The numerator can be generated by counting the number of ART patients screened for TB who were diagnosed with TB and started on anti-TB therapy during the reporting period.
These data should be captured in ART registers as well as additional data collection sources (e.g., facility-based TB screening registers or forms, TB specimen registers, TB microscopy result registers, GeneXpert data collection systems) that may contain relevant information (e.g., TB screening results, TB specimen testing results). Programs should modify the register as needed to easily capture this information.

Documentation of symptom screening is generally collected in patient charts but may also be collected in another aggregate partner-generated data source.

Screening for TB and/or initiation of anti-TB therapy might not happen at the same time that ART is started. For PLHIV new to HIV care, those who are diagnosed with TB are usually started on anti-TB therapy before they initiate ART (e.g., 2-8 weeks as per current recommendations). Regardless of when they occur relative to ART initiation, TB screening and initiation of TB therapy should be included for all patients who were currently on ART or who started ART at any time during the reporting period.

Patients on ART who achieve and maintain viral suppression minimize their risk of disease progression and HIV transmission. Viral suppression is a critical quality of service quality; unsuppressed viral load can be indicative of suboptimal treatment adherence and can lead to the development and spread of drug resistance.

This indicator is harmonized with GAM indicator “[People living with HIV who have suppressed viral loads.](www.indicatorregistry.org/indicator/people-living-hiv-who-have-suppressed-viral-loads)”","The numerator can be generated by counting the number of adults and children receiving antiretroviral therapy who have a suppressed viral load at the end of the reporting period. Count the patient if, during the reporting months, viral load has been recorded and is <1000 copies/mL. For countries with other thresholds (e.g., undetectable <50 copies/ml or <400 copies/ml), preliminary evidence from several studies suggests the proportion of those with 50 copies/ml or above and less than 1000 copies/ml is small, so no adjustment is required. The testing threshold value should be reported in the narrative for countries with thresholds other than <1000 copies/ml.

Viral-load testing should be routine rather than targeted (e.g., when treatment failure is suspected). If multiple viral-load tests are done annually for a person, only the last routine test result should be reported. Results from targeted viral loads should not be reported. If viral-load testing coverage is less than 75% of those receiving antiretroviral therapy in the reporting year, results should be interpreted with caution.

Tools for measuring viral load may vary across countries. Routine viral-load suppression tests from clinical and program data should be reported where available. In countries where such data are not available, results from HIV population-based surveys or drug-resistance surveys based on a random sample of people on antiretroviral therapy may be reported.
Countries should report the source of the numerator and denominator data, and data from both sources should be reported if available, although clinical and program data are preferred. If results from a survey are used, that should be included when reporting.

Where clinical and program data are available from routine monitoring systems, results will be recorded in patient files or in a laboratory system. Data should be de-duplicated where patients receive multiple viral-load tests in a year.

If an HIV population-based or drug-resistance survey is used in place of routine program monitoring data, measurement of viral load should be done for the entire population of HIV- positive individuals where ARV is detected in specimens. Self-reported treatment status has been shown to be of limited quality. Therefore, viral-load estimates among those who report receiving antiretroviral therapy should not be used.

This indicator is harmonized with GAM indicator “[Percentage of men 15–49 that are circumcised.](http://www.indicatorregistry.org/indicator/male-circumcision-prevalence)""","Estimates derived from population-based surveys (Demographic and Health Survey, AIDS Indicator Survey, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys or other representative surveys); this indicator will help to determine male circumcision prevalence. The total number of men circumcised should include all men circumcised regardless if circumcised at birth, as part of the VMMC program or at any other time during their lifetime.

The denominator for this indicator is the number of male populations estimates, disaggregated by age (<15, 15-29, 30+). This information is collected under the population estimates indicator in the IMPATTS (Implementation and Planning Attributes).

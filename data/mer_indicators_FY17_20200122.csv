",Site level: Facility only,Quarterly,"The indicator measures the ongoing growth of PrEP services. This measure is critical to assess progress in the program’s response to the epidemic in specific geographic areas, and the uptake and utility of PrEP among persons at substantially increased risk of HIV infection.

This indicator permits monitoring trends in use, but does not attempt to distinguish between different modes or regimens of PrEP or to measure the cost, quality or effectiveness of PrEP provided. These will each vary within and between countries and are liable to change over time.

PrEP has been shown to reduce incident infections among several populations including serodiscordant heterosexual couples, MSM, PWID, and transgender (TG). The WHO now recommends that oral PrEP containing tenofovir should be offered as an additional prevention choice for people at substantial risk, defined as HIV incidence > 3/100 person- years.
","The numerator can be generated by counting the number of people who are newly enrolled on PrEP in the reporting period, in accordance with national guidelines (or WHO/UNAIDS standards).

NEW is a state defined by an individual’s beginning in a PrEP program. It is expected that the characteristics of new clients are recorded at the time they newly initiate into a program.

Patients are “new” on PrEP only if they are naive to antiretroviral therapy for prevention of HIV infection and have not received oral or topical prophylaxis previously in any program.

Key population disaggregation* see Appendix 1 to support the identification of key populations at ART initiation; If a patient identifies as more than one of the KPs, please enter in all of those that are relevant (therefore KP disaggregations can equal more than the total).

NOTE: In accordance to PREP guidance, not all PREP beneficiaries are expected to fall within the KP disaggregates, therefore the total disaggregations for KP does not have to sum to the numerator total. As well, if a PREP beneficiary identifies as more than one KP, then the individual should be added to both disaggregations, therefore the KP disaggregations, could be more than the total numerator.

* Refer to medication-assisted therapy (MAT), if applicable

* Offer or refer to needle syringe program (NSP), if applicable

*Partner should also report the number of individuals tested under the indicator ""HTS_TST"" if HTS was conducted (and results were given) as part of the outreach activity. If it was a documented complete HTS referral to the facility, it can be counted as HTS_TST_TA. Please refer to the HTS_TST indicator definition sheet for details.



","Tracking systems must be able to reduce double-counting of individuals in a reporting period. The numerator can be generated by counting the number of de-duplicated individuals who were reached and had completed the appropriate prevention intervention(s) designed for the intended key population. For example, it means that when a unique individual receives HTS referral plus condoms and lubricant at more than one occasion during the reporting period, the person is counted only once for being reached for this indicator.

Furthermore, double-counting of all returning beneficiaries within the Q3-Q4 reporting period (April 1 – September 30) will also need to take place in Q4 reporting if they had already been counted under KP_PREV in Q1-Q2 of the same fiscal year. For example, if an individual had received prevention interventions under KP_PREV through PEPFAR-supported program in January 2017 and was counted as being reached in FY17 Q2 reporting cycle, and this same individual was later reached with prevention services again by PEPFAR-supported program in June 2017, that individual should **_NOT_** be reported again in the FY17 Q4 reporting period. This de-duplication is critical in order to accurately track the **_ANNUAL_** number of unique individuals reached by PEPFAR within a given fiscal year. Trend analysis of past performance KP_PREV data will be adversely affected with the change in frequency of KP_PREV reporting from annually to semi-annually if this de-duplication is ignored (i.e. annual number of KP_PREV reported within the same fiscal year would be inflated as the same individual would be counted twice if this de-duplication does not occur at Q4 reporting).

If possible, a unique identifier can be assigned. The use of a unique identifier can help programs monitor the frequency of contact/outreach of a single individual over time (i.e. Beneficiary A with unique identifier AW0901 had four documented outreach visits in FY17 but was only counted once under KP_PREV in FY17).","Data should be reviewed regularly for the purposes of program management, to monitor progress towards achieving targets, and to identify and correct any data quality issues.

",Site level: facility and community.,Semi-Annually,"PEPFAR is mandated to care for children orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV. Mitigating the impact that HIV is having on children and the families that support them is integral to a comprehensive HIV response. It is important to note that the definition of “affected” children includes, but is not limited to, children infected with HIV. PEPFAR recognizes that individuals, families, and communities are affected by HIV in ways that may hinder the medical outcomes of HIV-positive persons as well as the emotional and physical development of children orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS. A variety of services (per Technical Considerations 2015 and 2016) are supported through PEPFAR to mitigate these effects in order to improve health and well-being outcomes of adults and children.

The goal of OVC programs is to build stability and resiliency in children and families- exposed, living with or affected by HIV/AIDS through rigorous case management and provision and access to health and socio-economic interventions. This indicator, by disaggregating **“active”**, **“graduated”**, **“transferred”**, and **“exited without graduation”** measures how successful the OVC program is in building children and their families’ resiliency.

Therefore, all people who are dependent on opioids should be offered and have access to this service. The implementation of MAT programs should facilitate and enhance access to HIV-specific services for PWID, such as HIV testing services, provision and/or referral and linkages to ARV treatment programs, PMTCT for female PWID and a range of other prevention and harm reduction services.

* This indicator uses the number of people receiving post-GBV clinical services to measure service uptake. An increase in the number of people receiving post- GBV care will indicate that more patients are disclosing violence to providers and using the available services.

* GBV is defined as any form of violence that is directed at an individual based on his or her biological sex, gender identity or expression, or his or her perceived adherence to socially-defined expectations of what it means to be a man or woman, boy or girl. It includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse; threats; coercion; arbitrary deprivation of liberty; and economic deprivation, whether occurring in public or private life.

",Number of people receiving post- gender based violence (GBV) clinical care based on the minimum package,"* GBV: For PEPFAR, GBV is defined as any form of violence that is directed at an individual based on his or her biological sex, gender identity or expression, or his or her perceived adherence to socially-defined expectations of what it means to be a man or woman, boy or girl. It includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse; threats; coercion; arbitrary deprivation of liberty; and economic deprivation, whether occurring in public or private life. It can affect women and girls, men and boys, and other gender identities. PEPFAR is most likely to address physical and sexual intimate partner violence, including marital rape; sexual assault or rape; female genital cutting/mutilation; sexual violence against children and adolescents; and child marriage.

* Because of the challenges associated with ascertaining whether a person who experienced sexual violence did so because of their biological sex, gender identity, or his or her perceived adherence to socially defined norms of masculinity and femininity, ALL persons who experience sexual violence and present for care, independent of the cause, or of age and sex, should be counted under this indicator.

NOTE: This indicator DOES NOT include GBV Prevention activities or non- clinical community-based GBV response (e.g., shelter programs, case management).

This indicator will enable PEPFAR to:

* To determine the number of individuals that are suffering from GBV and reporting to clinical partners

* To assess whether post-GBV clinical services are being used.

* Gain an understanding of the uptake of post-GBV clinical services offered across PEPFAR countries.

* Provide important information to key stakeholders about PEPFAR programs that mitigate women and girls’ and other marginalized populations’ vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.

* Support efforts to assess the impact of post-GBV clinical services by correlating the reach (i.e., number of people served) of these services over time with outcomes related to GBV (and HIV/AIDS), as described through other data collection efforts such as survey data (DHS/PHIA/VACS).

* Identify programmatic gaps by analyzing the number and ages of people receiving services, as well as the reach of services in particular geographic areas.
","Data sources are standard program monitoring tools, such as forms, log books, spreadsheets and databases that national programs and /or partners develop or already use.

Data should be collected continuously at the point of service delivery (i.e., ANC, PMTCT, ART, etc.) and aggregated in time for PEPFAR reporting cycles.

The indicator can be generated by counting the number of persons receiving post-GBV clinical care, disaggregated by the **age group** and **sex of the client receiving the service**, as well as the **type of service** (sexual violence or emotional/physical violence) and PEP provision (see below for disaggregation information).

To adequately capture the provision of these services, logs and monitoring forms will need to be used wherever the services are offered. These forms will need to track both the outcome of the initial assessment and the provision of referrals or services. For PEP specifically, registries should collect both the administration of the PEP as well as its completion and the patient’s adherence.

**Special considerations**:

* As outlined in the _Program Guide for Integrating GBV Prevention and Response in PEPFAR Programs_ all programs seeking to address GBV must first and foremost protect the dignity, rights, and well-being of those at risk for, and survivors of, GBV. There are four fundamental principles for integrating a GBV response into existing programs and specific actions for putting these principles into practice. These principles are as follows:

    * Do no harm

    * Privacy, confidentiality, and informed consent

    * Meaningful engagement of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and GBV survivors

    * Accountability and M&E

This indicator is a required indicator for all PEPFAR teams and will be reported up to headquarters once a year at quarter 4.
",Number of service delivery points supported by PEPFAR that are providing fully integrated voluntary family planning services,See definition below for a PEPFAR-supported service delivery point. Note: a service delivery point is **NOT** the same as a site. There can be numerous service delivery points within one site.,Number of total service delivery points at a site supported by PEPFAR,"_Not collected through the data entry screened, determined by number of sites reporting service delivery area._",This has changed from an absolute count of the number of sites to have integrated family planning services to the number of service delivery areas within a site.,Site level: Facility by Service Delivery Area (SDA),Annually,"This output indicator aims to measure progress towards integrating voluntary FP within the PEPFAR platform at the service delivery level. It captures information about whether FP integration is occurring at various HIV service delivery points within PEPFAR supported sites. Many PEPFAR sites will have numerous service delivery points within each site. For example, if one hospital receives PEPFAR support for both the HIV treatment department AND the ANC department, then the FPINT_site total for that one site is 2 service delivery points.

This indicator will enable PEPFAR stakeholders to:

* Gain a basic, but essential, understanding of whether FP services are being integrated in PEPFAR-supported service delivery points.

* Identify gaps, including service contexts, countries, or regions with low levels of HIV/FP integration.

Inherent within this indicator is the principle that integrated HIV/FP program activities must respect a client’s right to make informed decisions about his or her reproductive life. This means that clients should have access to an appropriate and comprehensive range of contraceptive options; and/or to safer conception/pregnancy counseling depending upon their fertility desire and intentions. Judgements and personal opinions are not appropriate in a clinic setting.

This indicator will be used to monitor coverage of HIV/FP integration at a global level. **_Therefore, detailed information on completion of referrals, FP service uptake, types of contraceptive methods offered on site, and other critical components of integrated programs will not be captured through this indicator, but should be maintained at the site or programmatic level_**.
","**Definition: Voluntary Family Planning Service Provision**
In order to be considered as a PEPFAR-supported service delivery point that directly provides fully integrated voluntary FP services, **all 3 criteria below must be met**. If a service delivery point provides fewer than 3 of the services noted below, it should **not** be counted under this indicator.

**The PEPFAR-supported HIV service delivery point must provide** for all relevant clients, including partners in HIV discordant couples (as documented by standard operating procedures, guidelines, protocols, manuals and/or intake documents, etc.):

1. Assessment of voluntary FP needs through routine screening;

2. Provision of voluntary FP counseling (including safe pregnancy counseling for those wishing to become pregnant, or those who are pregnant);

3. Provision or referral of a broad range of modern contraceptive methods, in accordance with the National FP policy guidelines, for clients who voluntarily wish to delay or prevent pregnancy. It is very much preferred for methods to be available onsite. If referrals are given, they must include detailed information (e.g., facility location, hours of operation, etc.) about where methods can be accessed.

**Definition: Assess Voluntary Family Planning Needs Through Screening (Number 1 above)** 
In assessing FP needs, all clients as part of their routine care visit should be asked about their FP needs and practices. Depending upon the individual client and his or her needs, these can include: reproductive goals; prior pregnancies; living and family situation; FP knowledge; previously used FP methods and satisfaction with use; and any FP-related concerns. These needs should be assessed without expressing any personal biases about a client’s preference.

**Definition: Provide Voluntary Family Planning Counseling (including Safe Pregnancy Counseling) (Number 2 above)**
Quality voluntary FP counseling should cover a wide range of topics that are client and context specific, and that include both safe pregnancy counseling for individuals who wish to become pregnant as well as contraception for individuals who wish to avoid, space or delay pregnancy. “FP counseling” is not the same as ""FP education"". Depending upon the type of FP services that are offered at PEPFAR supported site; health providers or community mobilizers may provide EDUCATION and/or COUNSELING on FP.

Education activities may include distribution of printed materials, group health education and community outreach efforts among other interventions. Education helps to increase general knowledge on the benefits and importance of FP and increase support for FP use, as well as to link women and their partners to other FP services, including contraceptive method provision.

FP counseling is an interpersonal communication between the health provider and client where topics specific to the clients’ needs are discussed to help them determine if they want to use FP and if so; to help them choose and use the FP method of their choice. HIV service providers or all levels can be trained and supported to develop or improve their skills at FP counseling. A wide array of FP counseling materials exist that can be used in PEPFAR settings; including national FP flipcharts, counseling cards and informational handouts

Voluntary FP counseling should follow the standards and best practices outlined in the “Additional References” section below.

**Definition: Provision or Referral of a Broad Range of Modern Contraceptive Methods (Number 3 above)**
Per U.S. Government legislation, and in line with national FP policies, a broad range of methods should be provided to clients, allowing them to choose the method most appropriate for them, either directly or through referral. For an SDP to be counted towards this indicator, at least three modern contraceptive methods should be available either on site or through referral. Emergency contraception is an important FP method that should be available in all HIV settings as part of FP and gender based violence (GBV) services.
Information on modern contraceptive methods can be found in the references listed at the end of this sheet. All referrals should include detailed information about where methods can be accessed (e.g., facility location, operating hours, etc.).

**Definition: PEPFAR-Supported Service Delivery Point at a site**
A PEPFAR-supported service delivery point uses PEPFAR funds to directly provide HIV- related services. It offers one or more HIV-related services including but not limited to: HIV testing and counseling; prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT); anti- retroviral treatment (ART); screening and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections (OI); other health services for people living with HIV (e.g. positive health, dignity and prevention (PHDP), nutrition support, etc.), and prevention activities for priority populations (key populations and adolescent girls and young women). It can include fixed locations and/or mobile operations offering routine and/or regularly scheduled services. Examples include different HIV services within clinics, hospitals, health facilities and community-based organizations (government, private or NGO). Individual community health workers are not considered to be individual service delivery points. Rather, the organizations with which they are affiliated are considered to be the service delivery point(s).
PEPFAR service delivery points for FP/HIV integration include the following:

1. Care and Treatment (including Pediatric and Adolescent Care and Treatment Services) – this includes services where ART is initiated and monitored.

2. Antenatal and/or Maternity services - this includes FP education and healthy timing and spacing messages in the ANC setting (when a woman in pregnant and receiving PMTCT services and/or FP counseling and method provision post-partum.)

3. Priority Population Prevention services – this includes priority population programming, such as drop in centers and prevention sites focused on adolescent girls and young women (i.e. DREAMS). FP integration can also take place across the clinical cascade for priority populations, including care and treatment which would be recorded under care and treatment service delivery point

4. Key Population Prevention services – this includes programming for Men who have sex with men, People who identify as transgender, Sex workers, and People who inject drugs, such as drop in centers. FP integration can also take place across the clinical cascade for key populations, including care and treatment which would be recorded under care and treatment service delivery point.

5. HIV Testing services - includes counselling (pre-test information and post-test counselling); linkage to appropriate HIV services; and coordination with laboratory services to support quality assurance and the delivery of correct results. FP services can be made available with HIV testing services, especially for key populations and adolescent girls and young women as well as for HIV sero-discordant couples. (even if FP integration is targeting key or priority populations, if occurring in HTS the integration should be documented under HTS)

**Special Considerations:
1. HIV/FP Integration Principles**

As articulated in the FY14 COP guidance, USG-supported FP and HIV/AIDS programs must adhere to the following principles:

* People living with HIV (PLHIV) and their partners should be provided with information on, and be able to exercise voluntary choices about their health, including their reproductive health.

* The USG, including PEPFAR, supports a person‘s right to choose, as a matter of principle, the number, timing, and spacing of their children, as well as use of FP methods, regardless of HIV/AIDS status.

* FP use should always be a choice, made freely and voluntarily, independent of the
person‘s HIV status.

* **The decision to use or not to use FP should be free of any discrimination, judgment, stigma, coercion, duress, or deceit and informed by accurate, comprehensible information and access to a variety of methods.**

* Access to and provision of health services, including antiretroviral treatment, for PLHIV should never be conditioned on that person's choice to accept or reject any other service, such as family planning (other than what may be necessary to ensure the safe use of antiretroviral treatment and other drug interactions).

* PLHIV who wish to have children should have access to safe and non-judgmental pregnancy counseling services.


","Data should be reviewed regularly for the purposes of program management including monitoring progress towards achieving targets, and identifying and correcting any data quality issues. Follow PEPFAR Guidance for data quality review as circulated in Q4 reporting guidance.

**Potential data quality issues for FPINT_site**:

Indicator counts individual Service Deliver Points at Sites: This indicator counts the number of service delivery points (SDP) **NOT** the number of sites that integrate FP services. See above for SDP definition.

Denominator is greater than or equal to the Numerator: The total number of PEPFAR- supported service delivery points (the denominator) must be greater than or equal to the total number of PEPFAR-supported service delivery points that have integrated Family Planning (the numerator).

Service delivery modalities rationalized and simplified to avoid overlap and create mutually exclusive delivery modalities; HTS service delivery modalities reflect both facility and community settings.,"Site level: both facility and community by service delivery area.
**Note**: Data entry screens differ by facility and community levels.
","Quarterly
","This indicator is intended to monitor trends in the uptake of HTS (regardless of the service delivery modality and population group) within a country.

The disaggregation by test result provides information about the proportion of persons testing HIV positive and the effectiveness of HTS programs in identifying people living with HIV (PLHIV) over time.

Further disaggregations are intended to monitor access to and uptake of HTS by population (age, sex, test result), and HTS setting and service delivery modality. The findings can support national governments and PEPFAR programs to determine the coverage and identify gaps in HTS services. These data may also be useful for projecting programmatic commodities and system needs such as HIV test kits and other staffing resources, _although the numerator reflects the number of individuals tested, not the number of tests performed_.
","Existing HTS registers, log books, and reporting forms already in use to capture HTS can be revised to include the updated disaggregation categories. Examples of data collection forms include client intake forms, activity report forms, or health registers such as HTS registers, health information systems and non-governmental organization records.

Data for the numerator should be generated by counting the **total number of individuals who received HTS and their test results**.

**Note**: Although several other MER indicators (see below) may report on the HIV status of individuals, actual testing of individuals must be reported under HTS_TST. Thus any persons who are newly tested as part of the programs linked to the indicators listed below (i.e. PMTCT, TB, VMMC, Prevention services) must be reported as part of the HTS_TST indicator.

* PMTCT_STAT

* TB_STAT

* VMMC_CIRC

* PP_PREV

* KP_PREV

* OVC_HIVSTAT

**Note**: Serologic testing of pediatric patients should be counted under HTS_TST. However, HIV virologic testing of HIV-exposed infants should be counted under PMTCT_EID.

For an individual to be counted under this indicator, that individual’s HIV diagnosis must be confirmed as per in-country testing algorithms. For example, an HIV-positive rapid HIV test performed at the community- or facility- level must be confirmed with a second test, which may be performed at the same site or at a different facility. If the confirmatory test is performed at a different facility, then this may entail follow-up by implementing partners to confirm the diagnosis before reporting on this indicator.

**Note**: Testing for verification of HIV status before treatment initiation is different from confirmatory testing, since this is only done for persons who have already been diagnosed HIV-positive following the initial algorithm. All clients diagnosed HIV-positive should be retested with a second specimen and a second operator using the same testing strategy or algorithm before enrolling the client in care and/or initiating ART, but verification retesting is primarily done as a quality assurance activity to ensure those enrolled in treatment services are HIV positive. Thus, these verification retests should not be counted under HTS_TST, since this will have already been counted at the point of the initial confirmatory test.

**Disaggregates: Service Delivery Modality**

In addition to reporting the total number of individuals tested and receiving their test results and the total type of test results received (negative, positive), HTS_TST data should be disaggregated by service delivery modality, and then also by age/sex/test result within each service delivery modality.

Service delivery modalities are defined as:
        
1. Community-based testing - Any testing done outside of a designated health facility

* _Index case testing_: This refers to an approach focused on testing individuals in the social or sexual networks of HIV-positive persons, including family members, sexual partners, needle-sharing partners, and other high-risk contacts. Index patient testing can be done using novel approaches such as incentivized case finding, peer-driven outreach, and partner notification services. This approach can be done in other community-based settings (home-based, mobile, or other community platforms); community index testing includes if the index case finding/tested originated in the community, even if the subsequent testing was done in the facility. Importantly - If an individual could be reported under both index testing and another community modality, that person should be reported only once under community index testing.

* _Home-based testing_: Any testing that occurs in a person’s home, including door-to- door testing and targeted home visits

* _Mobile testing_: Including any ad hoc or temporary testing locations, such as a community center, school, or mobile unit (Testing related to VMMC services is not included here. Instead that should be reported under facility based testing)

* _VCT_: Any standalone VCT center that exists outside of a designated health facility (e.g. Drop-in-center, wellness clinic where HTS services are provided, site designated for key populations, etc.)

* _Other community platforms_: Including any other modality not captured above (e.g. Ad hoc testing campaign that does not satisfy the mobile testing definition). OVC testing should be entered under this modality.

* _Facility-based testing_: Any testing occurring inside a designated health facility

2. Index Case Testing

    * _Index Case Testing_: This refers to an approach focused on testing individuals in the social or sexual networks of HIV-positive persons, including family members, sexual partners, needle-sharing partners, and other high-risk contacts. Index patient testing can be done using novel approaches such as incentivized case finding, peer-driven outreach, and partner notification services.
        
    * Facility index testing includes if the index case finding/tested originated in the facility, even if the subsequent testing was done in the community.

    * This approach can be done in other facility-based settings as described above, but if an individual could be reported under both index testing and another modality, that person should be reported only once under index testing.

3. Provider Initiated Counseling and Testing in certain clinical settings, including:

    * _Inpatient_: Including surgery and any inpatient ward

    * _Pediatrics_: Testing for children under 5 in any health facility setting, such as an under 5/EPI (immunization or well child services) clinic. This does not include testing for malnourished children (see below), virologic testing, and non-diagnostic rapid HIV testing which is reported under PMTCT_EID. Children under 5 may be tested in other service delivery modalities as well (OPD), but if an individual could be reported under both “pediatrics” and another facility modality, that person should be reported only once under pediatrics. Index testing for family members above … age based on pediatrics clinics should be included under index testing.

    * _Malnutrition facilities_: Clinics and inpatient wards predominately dedicated to the treatment of malnourished children. While this service delivery modality may be part of either inpatient or outpatient services, if an individual could be reported under both malnutrition and another service delivery point, report an individual only once and under malnutrition.

    * _TB_: This includes all TB patients originating from TB clinics and contacts of TB patients. Refer to TB_STAT for guidelines on data collection for TB
    
    * _PMTCT (ANC Only)_: HIV testing for pregnant women as part of the PMTCT program at antenatal care clinics (ANC) to align with PMTCT_STAT. Refer to PMTCT_STAT reference sheet for guidelines on data collection.

    * _VMMC_: This is HIV testing for males as part of the VMMC programs both in facility based and mobile outreach programs VMMC programs. Testing is recommended through the VMMC program, although not mandatory. Refer to VMMC_CIRC for guidelines on data collection for VMMC.

    * _Other PITC_: this includes any other PITC modality that is not captured above, such as testing women and their partners or family members in labor and delivery wards; testing done in family planning centers, etc.

        b. Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT):
    
    * VCT is a form of client-initiated HTS, integrated into facilities that specifically provide this service. This is separate from services offered as part of inpatient or outpatient services as described above. Even though some VCT sites in health facilities might be linked with outpatient or inpatient services, if an individual could be reported under both VCT and another service delivery point, report an individual only once and under the non-VCT modality.

**Key Populations**

Provision of information (tested, tested positive, tested negative) on key Populations (FSW, MSM, Transgender, PWID, and people in prisons and other enclosed settings) who were tested and received their results should be reported here. Importantly, reporting on this disaggregate is optional.

_Key population disaggregation* see Appendix 1 to support the identification of key populations at HTS service delivery; If a patient identifies as more than one of the KPs, please enter in all of those that are relevant (therefore KP disaggregations can equal more than the total);_

**_NOTE: both KP-specific and clinical partners have the option to complete these disagg, but only if safe to maintain these files and to report._**

Age and sex data on KPs tested and receiving their results will not be reported—these disaggregates are separate and distinct from disaggregates for male/female. Please refer to the KP_PREV and PP_PREV indicator reference sheets for more information on working with KPs.

The first priority of data collection and reporting of HTS among key populations must be to do no harm. These data must be managed with confidentiality to ensure the identities of the individuals are protected to prevent further stigma and discrimination of key populations.

**Data Systems and Tools**

When developing or modifying existing M&E systems and tools to collect and report on this indicator, the following information should be considered (*** designates data elements that are required for HTS_TST reporting in DATIM)**:

4. This indicator counts the number of individuals tested not the number of test conducted. All efforts to ensure data are collected on individuals vs. number of tests should be made. Within HTS registers, collecting data on the following variables should be considered to help in these efforts:

    a. Retesting status: new tester, re-tester (i.e. tested in the last 3 months), retesting for verification of HIV-positive diagnosis

    b. HIV testing services - *HIV test results, date of HIV test, receipt of HIV test results, previously tested during the reporting period

    c. Demographic - Client’s Unique ID, name, *sex, and *age at time of HTS services

    d. Date at which individuals tested positive was linked with treatment

    e. Site - *site name and ID, district, region, province, and *service delivery modality

5. Using unique identifiers for individuals is one way to account for retesting and avoid double reporting if electronic systems are available to easily link data through these unique identifiers. Another approach is to record information about prior testing on the HTS client register.

6. For an individual to be counted under this indicator, that individual’s HIV diagnosis must be confirmed as per in-country testing algorithms. For example, an HIV-positive rapid HIV test performed at the community- or facility- level must be confirmed with a second test, which may be performed at the same site or at a different facility. If the confirmatory test is performed at a different facility, then this may entail follow-up by implementing partners to confirm the diagnosis before reporting on this indicator.

7. **Note**: Testing for verification of HIV status before treatment initiation is different from confirmatory testing, since this is only done for persons who have already been diagnosed HIV-positive following the initial algorithm. All clients diagnosed HIV- positive should be retested with a second specimen and a second operator using the same testing strategy or algorithm before enrolling the client in care and/or initiating ART, but verification retesting is primarily done for quality assurance of treatment services. Thus, these retests should not be counted under HTS_TST, since this will have already been counted at the point of the initial confirmatory test.

8. Patient level Deduplication: adding to the HTS facility and community registers (has patient been tested in the last 3 months). This additional data point in the patient
testing registries can help partners de-duplicate at the reporting level.



","Only one age disaggregation type is used for age/sex/test result received: The number of individuals newly receiving ART must be disaggregated by age and sex. If possible, the full age/sex disaggregations should be used. If the full age/sex disaggregations are not possible, then, and only then, should the aggregated age/sex disaggregations be used, do NOT complete both age/sex disaggregations.

Numerator ≥ subtotal of each disaggregate group: The total number of individuals receiving HTS (numerator) should be equal to the sum of each individual disaggregation group (age/sex/test result, service delivery modality). If the sum of each individual disaggregation group (age/sex/test result, service delivery modality) is greater than the total number of individuals receiving HTS (numerator), then there were more individuals entered for the disaggregations than for the overall number of individuals receiving HTS and this should be corrected. If the sum of each individual disaggregation group (age/sex/test result, service delivery modality) is less than the total number of individuals receiving HTS, then some data
are missing for the disaggregations and this should be corrected.
",Sum results across all reporting periods.,"**Numerator:** Number of individuals who received HIV Testing Services (HTS) and received their test results

Community Service Delivery Modality **(Required)**

",Track progress toward ensuring that all pregnant women who attend PEPFAR supported antenatal care (ANC) know their HIV status and are initiated on ART.,"The data source is the ANC register.

There is also a risk of undercounting if those women who already knew their HIV status prior to attending ANC are not documented, therefore the ANC register should at a minimum should document both “previously known positive” and “newly tested positive”. Finally “known negative” (ie. women who tested HIV negative prior to current
pregnancy) is not reported in DATIM however it may be appropriate to report “known

",Site Level: facility,Quarterly,"This indicator measures the extent to which infants born to HIV-positive women receive virologic testing to determine their HIV status within the first 2 months and for those not tested by 2 months, how many were tested between 2 and 12 months of age. Additionally, the yield of HIV testing at 2 months of age maybe a useful proxy of early mother-to-child transmission rates if coverage of testing is > 80%.

Only the first test for each HIV exposed infant should be counted in this indicator. Even though there is ongoing exposure of infants to HIV (through breastfeeding), this indicator is only measures early access to testing, and not repeat testing of exposed infants. HIV status of infants at the end of the breastfeeding period and the outcomes of the PMTCT program would be measured in PMTCT_FO.
","This indicator should be collected from the clinical source (ie. HIV-exposed infant registers or patient records) to assure unduplicated patient counting and receipt of results to inform patient care. HIV-exposed infant registers should be used to count exposed infants and virologic test results. (If available information should come from electronic systems). If the standard report does not contain all the required information, individual patient files should be used. Additional supporting information for this indicator can be obtained from standard laboratory information systems (i.e. DNA PCR log books or electronic systems), but the virologic test results must be able to be linked to a specific patient.

Only virologic tests should be included in this indicator. A virologic test is a test used for HIV diagnosis in infants up to 18 months of age. The most commonly used form of virologic testing is HIV DNA PCR on dried blood spots (DBS). Three other types of testing should not be reported: 

1. Serologic testing of children should not be reported in this indicator. (See HTS_TST for additional details). 

2. Virologic tests conducted with the purpose of confirming the diagnosis of HIV, 

3. Virologic tests used for clinical monitoring of children on ART, such as viral load quantification. **_Additionally, only the first test should be counted for each infant, even if they have had more than one virologic test done during the reporting period_**.

The numerator is divided into tests collected/sent before 2 months of age and those collected/sent between 2 and 12 months of age. Age is documented at the time the DBS is collected and not when the result is returned. It is likely that at the time of reporting there will be tests that have been collected/sent but for which no result is documented in the register or patient record. Partners should report all tests collected/sent even if no result has been recorded in the patient record/register at the time of reporting.
","Review all sites with >100% coverage of testing at 12 months and/or 100% positivity (EID_POS). In general the % tested should not be above 100% at a site, however it is possible that some women identified in PMTCT_STAT_POS might deliver within a reporting period but the infant may not receive virologic test until the following period as there is not always a 1:1 correspondence between POS women identified and infants delivered in a reporting period.

","Number of beneficiaries (<18 years old including “active”, “graduated”, “transferred”, and “exited without graduation”) served by PEPFAR OVC programs for children affected by HIV/AIDS at Q4.","This is a new indicator for MER 2.0 and OUs are required to report on it during FY17. This indicator formerly called OVC_ACC (MER 1.0) and OVC_KNOWNSTAT (in the original MER
2.0 target setting documentation) was changed to OVC_HIVSTAT to reflect that HIV status is self-reported to the implementing partner by the OVC or OVC caregiver.
","Site level, community",Semi-Annually,"This indicator will be tracked through routine program monitoring semi- annually through the POART process. Since report of HIV status is essential to effective case management, the OVC TWG will gauge progress at OU level to ensure that OVC implementing partners are proactively promoting reporting of HIV status for all enrolled children and ensuring that those who are positive are enrolled and retained in ART treatment.

**Rationale**:

Given the elevated risk of HIV infection among children affected by and vulnerable to HIV, it is imperative for PEPFAR implementing partners to monitor HIV status among OVC beneficiaries, and to facilitate access and retention in ART treatment for those who are HIV positive. When the implementing partner knows the HIV status, the program can contribute to ensuring that the children are linked to appropriate care and treatment services, all essential elements of quality case management. OVC programs can also play an important role in family-centered disclosure, for those who are HIV positive.

* This indicator is NOT intended to be an indicator of HIV tests performed or receipt of testing results, as these are measured elsewhere and test results are frequently unavailable to community organizations due to health facility concerns about patient confidentiality.

* This indicator is NOT intended to imply that all OVC beneficiaries require an HIV test. OVC with known positive or negative status do not need to be tested. Only OVC with no HIV status in the reporting period should be assessed for HIV risk.

* Status disclosure to the implementing partner is NOT a prerequisite for enrollment or continuation in an OVC program. OVC programs serve persons of positive, negative, and unknown HIV status appropriate to their needs and vulnerability to HIV.

* This indicator captures if implementing partners are tracking the self-reported HIV status of the orphans and vulnerable children they serve and enrollment in ART for those who are positive. Testing results for OVC who are referred for testing should be reported under HTS_TST based on the service delivery point where they were tested

* This indicator also captures if implementing partners are tracking if the orphans and vulnerable children they serve who report to be HIV positive are successfully linked to and retained in treatment and care.

* This indicator is a subset from OVC_SERV. Only OVC who were reported under OVC_SERV <18 at Q4 should be included in the denominator for this indicator.

* Since this is not a testing indicator, HIV positivity yield should not be calculated based on this indicator. Yield calculations should only be made by testing partners.

","Data sources for this indicator include HIV test results that are self-reported by OVC (or their caregivers), results of HIV Risk Assessments conducted by implementing partners, registers, referral forms, client records, or other confidential case management and program monitoring tools that track those in treatment and care.

Implementing partners will record the OVC beneficiary’s self-reported HIV status –semi- annually.

“Reported HIV positive to IP” includes beneficiaries <age 18 who report to the IP that they are HIV positive based on an HIV test conducted during or prior to the reporting period (regardless of where the test occurred). All entries for “reported HIV positive to IP” should be further disaggregated as “currently receiving ART” or “not currently receiving ART.” This also includes beneficiaries <age 18 who report that they are HIV positive based on an HIV test conducted during previous project reporting periods.

“Reported HIV negative to IP” includes beneficiaries <age 18 who report that they are HIV negative to the IP based on an HIV test conducted during the reporting period (regardless of where the test occurred). For a child who reports multiple tests within the current period, use most recent test.

“No HIV status reported to the IP” includes beneficiaries who fall into one of the below described categories:

* “Test not indicated” – includes beneficiaries who based on a risk determination made by the implementing partner do not require a test during the reporting period. (Forthcoming Operational Considerations for OVC Programs and HTS will include further information on determining whether a test is indicated)

* “Other reasons” – includes all beneficiaries (OVC_SERV <age 18) not entered in above categories. This may include, for example, children for whom testing was indicated but did not test, or children who were tested but did whose result was not reported to the partner as well as children whose HIV status was not reported to the implementing partner for any other reason.

OVC entered as ““Reported HIV positive to IP” in the previous reporting period, should continue to be reported as positive during the current reporting period and their enrollment in ART noted. Beneficiaries < age 18 entered as “Reported HIV negative to IP” during the previous reporting period and children entered as “No HIV test reported to the IP” in the previous reporting period should be reassessed by the implementing partner to determine whether testing is indicated and the results entered as outline above.
","The OVC_HIVSTAT numerator (OVC <18 years who have reported to the OVC implementing partner that they are HIV positive) should not exceed the denominator , OVC_SERV (<18 years) and the numerator should be larger or equal to the number of OVC who are HIV positive and enrolled in ART.

","Calculated indicator in DATIM, sum of: HIV-infected, HIV-uninfected, HIV-final status unknown, died without status known.

It is recommended to wait to collect the 18 month visit outcomes until the patient is 24 months old for the following reasons: 1) this allows for children who present several months late to their 18 month visit to be included in the numerator and 2) cohort reporting is easiest when monthly reporting by facilities is used and where the birth month and the reporting month are the same calendar month (i.e., for infants born in January 2012, their 24 month reporting month would be January 2014, rather than using the 18 month reporting month of July 2013).

For COP16, no targets are required for this indicator, and the number of disaggregates has been reduced and simplified.",Site Level: facility,Annually,"In settings where national guidelines support breastfeeding of HIV-exposed infants, antibody testing of all HIV-exposed children at 18 months of age and/or 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding is recommended to determine final HIV status (‘final outcome’/FO) of HIV-exposed children. To accomplish this goal, it is recommended to identify infants at birth or at the first infant follow-up visit and track them through the end of the breastfeeding period. This indicator measures progress toward ensuring that all infants born to HIV-positive women have an outcome documented. In settings where a mother-infant register is utilized and/or it is common practice for HIV-infected women to breastfeed less than or more than 18 months please describe in the narrative the final outcome time point.
","To report on this indicator PEPFAR supported sites would ideally use registers or facility held cards for HIV exposed infants that collect longitudinal information on follow-up and are organized by birth month of infants. This methodology is referred to as birth cohort reporting.

Two examples of birth cohort reporting:

1. In Kenya, this indicator was first piloted by PEPFAR and the Ministry of Health in Western Kenya and is currently integrated into the national HIV summary reporting tool. Data from the facility HIV exposed infant longitudinal follow-up register, which organizes infants by birth-month cohorts, are aggregated into a report summarizing outcomes for infants reaching 24 months of age during each month.

2. In Malawi, clinic staff complete monthly follow up reporting forms as part of the national quarterly supervision visits using data collected directly from HIV-exposed infant cards which are kept in a binder that is organized by birth month (no HIV exposed register is used).

As an example for those infants born in FY 2015, the outcomes would be reported in FY 2017.

Both approaches allow a paper-based health facility records to quickly identify the number of HIV-exposed infants registered in the birth cohort at any time between 0 and 18 months of age (denominator).","By design this indicator should equal 100% if all outcomes are known regardless of outcome type. This allows for facilities to check that all HIV-exposed infants have an outcome assigned to them during the reporting process. Data utilization requires reviewing the disaggregated data to understand the specific outcomes of interest. In settings where HIV-exposed infant registers do not allow for documentation of all disaggregated outcomes, country teams should report only on available disaggregates even if the aggregate indicator is less than 100%, however this should be specified in the narrative.

The denominator should include those “Transferred In” and those “Transferred Out” as long as for “Transferred In” there is documentation that HIV-exposed infants were registered at their original site in the birth cohort at any time between 0 and 18 months of age and were born 24 months prior to the reporting period. “Transferred Out” should be reported under HIV status unknown. The inclusion of Transfers-In/Out provides a quality check to ensure that all exposed infants have an outcome assigned to them during the reporting process such that the sum of the numerator disaggregation equals the denominator. However this may lead to outcomes for >100% of HIV positive pregnant women (PMTCT_STAT_POS) identified at a site so this comparison should not be used as a logic check.

    * For the numerator to be calculated, implementing partners are required to report:

    * **HIV-infected** = Number of HIV- exposed infants identified as HIV- infected at any point during follow- up. HIV-infected includes infants and children with diagnostic virologic or serologic confirmation of HIV- infection (DNA PCR before 18 months; rapid test at 18 months) and those with a presumptive HIV diagnosis where DNA PCR is not available. Site should also maintain data on HIV infected infants and whether they are linked or not linked to ART services, or whether they have no information on patient linkage to ART programs.

    * **HIV-uninfected** = Number of HIV- exposed infants with a negative 18 month antibody test documented. Based on national guidelines, countries should determine if “HIV- uninfected” includes infants with a documented negative antibody test that was done at least 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding but before 18 months of age.

    * **HIV final status unknown** = Sum of the following disaggregates (not reported in DATIM but should be documented at site level)

        * In care but no test done: Number of HIV-exposed infants who attended 18 month visit but no antibody test result is documented (unknown FO)

        * Lost to follow-up = Number of HIV-exposed infants who did not attend the 18 month visit (unknown FO)

        * Transferred out (unknown FO) = Number of HIV-exposed infants who transferred out between 0 and 18 months without confirmation of HIV-infection (unknown FO)

    * **Died without status known** = Number of HIV-exposed infants who are documented to have died without confirmation of HIV-infection between 0 and 18 months. Note: HIV- exposed infants who are HIV infected and later confirmed to have died or transferred out during follow-up are still counted under HIV infected and not died or transferred out.

This is particularly critical in the context of current revisions to country-specific ART eligibility.

Reporting the number of new patients enrolled on ART at both the national and overall PEPFAR program levels is critical to monitoring the HIV services cascade, specifically the successful linkage between HIV diagnosis and initiating ART.

Count the number of adults and children who are currently receiving ART in accordance with the nationally approved treatment protocol (or WHO/UNAIDS standards) at the end of the reporting period.

The current on ART count should equal the number of adults and children with HIV infection who ever started ART minus those patients who are not currently on treatment at the end of the reporting period.

* Patients on ART who initiated or transferred-in during the reporting period should be counted.

* Patients who have received enough ARVs to last to the end of the reporting period should be counted including those patients that pick up several months of antiretroviral drugs at one visit

* HIV-positive pregnant women who are eligible for and are receiving antiretroviral drugs for their own treatment are included. HIV-positive pregnant women initiating lifelong ART through PMTCT (Option B+) will count as “current” on ART under this indicator. These include HIV-infected pregnant women who:
    * Have newly initiated ART during the current pregnancy

    * Are already on ART at the beginning of the current pregnancy

Patients excluded from the Current on ART count are patients who died, stopped treatment, transferred out, or are lost to follow-up (LTFU). LTFU is defined as a patient who has not received ARVs in the last 90 days (three months) following their last _missed_ appointment or _missed_ drug pick-up. (Note: As models of service delivery change to reflect longer visit intervals for stable patients, it is important to emphasize the definition of LTFU applies to both _missed_ visits or _missed_ drug pick-up, but does not apply who have not received ARVs in the last 90 days (three months) following their last _attended_ appointment or _attended_ drug pick-up. As that interval between scheduled visits for stable patients maybe longer than 3 months.

This indicator should be reported from both PEPFAR supported sites in the private or public sector.

Patients currently receiving treatment from mobile clinics can be reported in two ways. Firstly if the mobile clinic is associated (receives commodities, reports to, is staff by) a nearby health facility, then these individuals should be reported by that facility. Secondly, if a mobile clinic is stationary for more than 2 reporting periods, it should be added to the PEPFAR facility list with geocodes and data should be reported for this mobile clinic directly.

**For age /sex disaggregates**:
CURRENT is a state defined by treatment status when last seen, so it is expected that characteristics of these clients would be updated each time they are seen by a program. Age represents an individual’s age at the end of the reporting period or when last seen at the facility. For example, a 14-year-old child will be counted as currently receiving
treatment in the <15 age category at the end of reporting period “A”. During reporting
period “B” the child turns age 15 and so at the end of this reporting period the child will be counted under the 15+ age category.

**DO NOT include**:
Patients who receive ARVs for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) or short term ART only for prevention (PREP) should not be reported in this indicator.

",Track progress toward ensuring that all pregnant women who attend PEPFAR supported antenatal care (ANC) know their HIV status and are initiated on ART.,"Data source is the ANC or PMTCT register depending on country context (in many high HIV prevalence settings information on the number of women receiving ART regimens is integrated into the ANC register). There is a risk of double counting as a pregnant woman receiving ART at ANC should have multiple visits for each pregnancy therefore partners should ensure a data collection and reporting system is in place to minimize double counting of the same pregnant women across visits including a paper based longitudinal ANC or PMTCT register (meaning a register that is able to record all information about 1 pregnancy in one location, with rows or columns that allow for recording information on multiple visits during that pregnancy) or an electronic medical record/patient tracking system. There is also a risk of undercounting if those women who already on ART prior to attending ANC are not documented, therefore the ANC register should document both “New on ART” and “Already on ART at the beginning of the current pregnancy”. Women who initiate ART while breastfeeding should not be counted under this indicator, and should instead be reported as part of the TX_NEW indicator (see TX_NEW, disaggregate group pregnancy/breastfeeding status).

Note: Those women reported in PMTCT_ART including newly enrolled on ART and already on ART at the beginning of pregnancy should also be reported in the TX_CURR indicators.
","Review any site with over 100% coverage or very low coverage to ensure they reflect expected results. In general, services should be reported at the site where they are delivered (however PMTCT_ART-“already on treatment” and PMTCT_STAT_POS “known positive at entry” are exceptions, see details under description of disaggregate below). Therefore coverage at site level must be understand within the context of the service delivery model at that site. For example, in local areas where ART is integrated into ANC and low volume PMTCT sites are only testing for HIV and then referring women to other facilities for ART, the expectation is that for one individual PMTCT_STAT_POS (newly tested) will be documented at one facility and PMTCT_ART (new on ART) would be documented at another facility leading to the appearance of greater than >100% coverage at one site and 0% coverage at another.

Compare the number of HIV-positive pregnant women newly initiating ART (PMTCT_ART disaggregate) and the number individuals newly initiated on ART (TX_NEW disaggregate) who are pregnant (disaggregation of the new on treatment indicator). It is expected that women are new ART initiations are reported in both indicators, however the data source is often different (ANC/PMTCT register for PMTCT_ART and ART register for TX_NEW) and to
discrepancies can provide better understanding of data quality.

**LTFU** is defined as a patient who has not received ARVs in the last 90 days (three months) following their last missed appointment or missed drug pick-up.

**Died**: Patients that are documented death during the previous 12 months period.

**Stopped ART**: Patient intentionally stops ART, usually, but not always in discussion with the clinical team.

**Known Transfers**: Patients who have transferred in with a known treatment initiation date that falls within the reporting period should be counted. Conversely, patients who transferred out of the facility should not be counted in the numerator (or denominator, see below)

**Note**: this indicator does not collect adherence information, but only retention, therefore The numerator does not require patients to have been on ART continuously for the 12-month period. Patients may be included in the numerator (and denominator) if they have missed an appointment or drug pick-up or temporarily stopped treatment during the 12 months since initiating treatment, as long as they are recorded as still being on treatment at month 12.

For example. A patient who started ART in September 2016 would be considered “on ART at 12 months” (in September 2017) if:

* The patient visited the facility and received ARVs in September 2017; **OR**

* The patient had enough ARVs to last through the end of September 2017 (month 12) based on the last drug pick-up (e.g., patient received 60 days of drug on August 15th, or patient received 90 days of drug on July 1st, etc.).

However, the patient would NOT be considered “on ART at 12 months” if:

* The patient did NOT have enough ARVs to last through the end of September 2017 (e.g., patient received 30 days of drug on August 1st); OR

* The patient had died, transferred out, stopped ART, or was lost to follow-up at the end of September 2017.
","Total number of adults and children who initiated ART in the 12 months prior to the beginning of the reporting period, including those who have died and those who have stopped ART. Does not include transfer outs.

The denominator is defined as the number of all adults and children who were initiated on treatment in the 12-month period before the reporting period. The denominator includes those “New” on ART as well as those who “Transferred In” if they have a cohort-start date
within the reporting period of interest. However, transfers-out should be taken out of both the denominator as well as the numerator. It is assumed that if a patient transfers out from an ART facility, that
patient will be a “transfer in” at a new ART facility.

For example, for the reporting period October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017, this will include all patients who started ART during the 12- month period from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016. This includes all patients, both those on ART as well as those who have died, stopped ART or were lost to follow-up (LTFU).

Only sites that have been operational for at least 24 months prior to the end of the reporting period should report. PEPFAR country teams may use the USG FY reporting period as the timeframe for the 12- month cohort. Teams may also wish to ‘lag’ by 1-3 months the cohort- months comprising the annual cohort, in order to allow sufficient time for reporting from data sources (i.e., implementing partners and/or national systems).

",,"Age/Sex disaggregates aligned across clinical cascade.

24 and 36 months were added as optional time periods to monitor changes to retention of these patients as models of service delivery change for stable patients on ART (the definition of stable varies across contexts, but often excludes patients on ART for less than 12 months)

(Note: As models of service delivery change to reflect longer visit intervals for stable patients, it is important to emphasize the definition of LTFU applies to both missed visits or missed drug pick-up, but does not apply who have not received ARVs in the last 90 days (three months) following their last attended appointment or attended drug pick-up. As that interval between scheduled visits for stable patients maybe longer than 3 months.)
",,Annually,"This indicator measures the proportion of individuals who have been retained on antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART is viewed by the scientific community and PEPFAR not only as essential for decreasing morbidity and mortality, but also as a highly effective approach to prevent HIV transmission. High retention is one important measure of program success, specifically in reducing morbidity and mortality, and is a proxy for overall quality of the ART program. Monitoring the program level retention is a critical quality of service indicator at the site, national and PEPFAR program levels as it can highlight barriers to health seeking behaviors and/or gaps in access to and provision of health services.","Information should come from electronic systems (EMR) if possible. Where electronic systems do not exist ART registers/databases and cohort/group analysis forms can be used to count patients that have been retained after 12, 24 or 36 months on ART.

This indicator should NOT be estimated. This indicator should be calculated directly from information gathered in standard cohort ART registers or electronic patient level databases.

Sites are required to disaggregate retention by pregnancy and breastfeeding and specific age/sex disaggregates (see data element below). In order to collect this information ART registers, cohort/group analysis forms, and EMRs must document age, sex, pregnancy status, and breastfeeding status on the date of ART initiation.

Of note, for reporting purposes a three-month grace period should be observed following drug pick-up, before concluding a patient is actually LTFU. However, while practical, if follow-up of patients is delayed till LTFU is official the majority of clients who do not present by three months of last missed appointment/drug pick-up are very unlikely to return thereafter. Therefore, for patient management, the facility should make every effort to contact a patient as soon as s/he misses an appointment and/ or drug pick-up (by phone, via community health worker) rather than waiting for the prescribed 90 days. This is particularly important when patients are routinely seen every three to six months (a patient may not have been seen for up to nine months if the facility adheres to the waiting period before attempting contact). LTFU is an ambiguous outcome that may often include patients who have self-transferred (silent transfer, without proper documentation or referral from their original primary care facility) or have died for which there is no documentation. Every effort should be made to document the more concreate outcomes for those not on ART (i.e. died, stopped ART, transfer out) to make the information more useful.

Checking this frequently can help to avoid stockouts through active supply chain management.

A view of each level of the system (Central and Intermediate sites), using this metric can also help to locate bottlenecks within the system, which could prevent patients from receiving needed commodities; cause needless stock-outs, or needless expiries.
","The country’s supply chain standard operating procedures should outline the min and max levels for each level of the system. These levels were defined by the needed throughput (the amount of pharmaceuticals intended to flow through the system in a given period), the space available and the frequency of distribution.

Observations of storage site and level-specific quantity of stock should be available through one or several of the following: the Procurement Planning and Monitoring Report for HIV and FP commodities (for condoms), a warehouse monitoring system, regular program monitoring reports, an existing logistics management information system, stock status reports/stock keeping records/regular physical counts, order forms from the central/regional/district/other levels, or regular supervision visits.

For the required central level and at least one intermediate level, there may be numerous observations (through physical counts performed or spot checks) of stock status for the products of interest annually, or there may be monthly counts, either way, the stock status will be monitored closely and updated with each transaction. These observations should be analyzed in this fashion:

* Document observations for each product of interest.

* Sort observations for each product into “quantities between maximum and minimum quantities/months of stock” and quantities above or below maximum and minimum.

* Number of observations where quantities are between maximum and minimum are the numerator.

* Total observations available are the denominator.

Example 1: if the Central Medical Store (CMS) has monthly stock observations for RTKs, and nine of which are within max and min levels but the remaining three represent a stockout then for the CMS the resulting measurement would be 9/12 or 75%

Example 2: If there are ten regions in a country and the regional medical stores report to the CMS quarterly, then ideally there should be 40 observations. Of these observations 25 are stocked according to plan for ARVs. In this scenario the resulting measurement for ARVs at the regional level is 25/40 or 62.5%.

",,Annually,"_How is data used to monitor the PEPFAR program_

It is widely acknowledged that the lack of trained health workers is a major barrier to scaling up health services. The lack of a sufficient workforce in countries presents a serious challenge to every area of health. The data will tell us the number of new health workers who are available to enter the health workforce each year as a result of PEPFAR support.
","_How is the data collected (highlight data source, issues with double counting and important components of data collection that ensure data quality) (In general this is in the old MER reference sheets but might be duplicated multiple times and so the language can get cleaned up._

Training under this indicator is defined as “pre-service” training – the training of “new” health workers (see definition below). Training generally occurs prior to the individual entering the health workforce in his or her new position (with the exception of certain training that may occur on-the job but that prepares health workers to function as a new cadre or with an expanded scope of practice in the health system). A health worker who advances to a higher cadre (e.g., a clinical assistant who completes training to become a clinical officer) shall be counted as a “new” health worker for the purposes of this indicator. The HRH goal is to expand the number of workers in the workforce and increase access to care through the advancement of current workers to higher level cadres through additional training and education.

Pre-service training institutions are university-based or affiliated schools of medicine, nursing, public health, social work, laboratory science, pharmacy, and other health-related fields. Non-professional or paraprofessional training would be any accredited and nationally recognized pre-service program that is a requirement for this cadre’s entry into the workforce.

“In-service” and “continuing education” training should not be included in the count for this indicator, but continue to be encouraged. These types of training may be captured by other indicators within program areas (e.g., supply chain).

**In order to count the duration of training must meet or exceed a minimum of 6 months**. For example, community health workers who receive a 3-month training course cannot be counted here. The training duration may be a combination of classroom and practical field time to arrive at six months.

A pre-service training program must be nationally accredited, or at the minimum meet national and international standards. The program must also have specific learning objectives, a course curriculum, expected knowledge, skills, and competencies to be gained by participants, as well as documented minimum requirements for course completion. The duration and intensity of training will vary by cadre; however, all training programs should have at a minimum the criteria listed above.

Individuals may be in training over many reporting periods; however, only participants who have successfully completed their training should be counted.

Successful completion of training may be documented by diploma, certificate or other evidence of completion of the program and subsequent eligibility to enter service.

Individuals not meeting these documented requirements should not be counted in this indicator.

“Health workers” refers to individuals involved in safeguarding and contributing to the prevention, promotion and protection of the health of the population (both professional and auxiliary-professionals). The categories below describe the different types of health workers to be considered under this indicator. This is not an exhaustive list of all health workers and position titles may vary from country to country.

For the purposes of this indicator, health workers may include the following but is not limited to:

* Clinical professionals, including doctors, nurses, midwives, laboratory scientists, pharmacists, medical technologists, and psychologists. They usually have a tertiary education and most countries have a formal method of certifying their qualifications.

* Clinical officers, medical and nursing assistants, lab and pharmacy technicians, auxiliary nurses, auxiliary midwives, T&C counselors. They should have completed a diploma or certificate program according to a standardized or accredited curriculum and support or substitute for university-trained professionals.

* Workers in a health ministry, hospital and facility administrators, human resource managers, monitoring and evaluation advisors, epidemiologists and other professional staff critical to health service delivery and program support.

* Social service workers including social workers, child and youth development workers, social welfare assistants.

PEPFAR support includes funding in the areas of curriculum development, teacher training and support, tuition/scholarships, infrastructure, materials/equipment, and practica/internships. For example, full or partial support of student tuition or scholarships, teacher salaries, and expansion/refurbishment of pre-service training facilities could all count under this indicator depending on the investment.

i.e. prevention, treatment and other HIV support at PEPFAR-supported facility sites

Definition: This indicator is the number of full-time equivalent positions (FTE) working on HIV (“HIV FTE”) at PEPFAR facility sites. Calculate part-time positions working exclusively on HIV, or full-time positions working on several areas including HIV and other illnesses, as fractions, based on hours worked relative to full-time equivalency hours. Full time equivalency hours should be the standard listed in the cadre’s scheme of service and/or Ministry of Health guidelines.

This is NOT a cumulative total, but a one-time count undertaken during the final quarter. Only filled staff positions at respective facility should be counted.
A “PEPFAR supported site” for the purpose of this indicator should include any facility site in the PEPFAR geographic organizational hierarchy list in DATIM, which also reported any site- level programmatic target or result during the same reporting period. Omit community sites. Omit facilities which were previously supported by PEPFAR, but were not assigned any targets nor reported any results for any program area during the same reporting period.

Include all health care workers irrespective of whether any or all are receiving PEPFAR support (this is captured in HRH_CURR.)
",_This indicator is neither a numerator nor a denominator_.,,,,New indicator,,Annually,"HIV/AIDS has placed significant demands on the already constrained health workforce in many low-income countries. The rapid scale-up of ART is placing additional demands on the health workforce.

In the majority of PEPFAR countries, there are overall shortages of HRH, particularly in rural and remote areas, leading to insufficient numbers of health workers according to internationally recommended levels (2.3 doctors, nurses, midwives/1,000 population). Many countries experience HRH shortages and/or imbalances by population densities (e.g., HRH shortages in rural areas) that are not related to population health needs, including HIV epidemiology. Addressing density, distribution, and overall utilization of HRH is important in increasing access to HIV services.

This indicator allows PEPFAR to analyze the availability of staff to provide HIV services at PEPFAR supported facilities. Data should be reviewed against site target achievement and investment. The first year of data collection will serve as an Integral benchmark for continued analysis.

Teams can also look at this indicator in conjunction with HRH_CURR that captures number of PEPFAR supported workers at PEPFAR-supported sites. This will allow PEPFAR to conduct analysis to determine if the number of PEPFAR-supported staff is appropriate vis-à-vis the number of other staff at the facility providing HIV services.

There is no universal benchmark against which to measure these data and no ideal PEPFAR to non-PEPFAR ratio. However, over time we would hope to see a decrease in the number of PEPFAR-supported staff. As this happens countries should carefully monitor any changes total number of staff working in HIV service delivery at sites and quality of services.

","To guide quality of data collection, a data collection template has been provided and posted to PEPFAR.net that gathers key data on the inventory or numbers of health care workers at each facility supporting HIV service delivery.

PEPFAR team or Implementing Partners (IP) should collect and report on this data during the last quarter of the year. The data collection template is a component of a rapid site level health workforce assessment tool developed by the PEPFAR HRH TWG, aligned with the first objective of the PEPFAR HRH Strategy. Where possible utilization of the entire rapid site-level health workforce assessment tool is encouraged to get a more comprehensive set of site-level HRH data that goes beyond what is required for HRH_STAFF.
Designate one IP per site to collect HRH_STAFF. If more than one IP is working at the same PEPFAR supported facility, teams should determine which IP will collect data for HRH_STAFF and/or undertake the fuller rapid HRH site-level assessment. Country teams need to collect data from all PEPFAR-supported irrespective of PEPFAR’s financial support of health workers at a particular site (as captured by HRH_CURR.)

Number of health workers reported should be expressed as full-time equivalency (FTE) positions as outlined in data collection template, including part-time health workers or health workers who work part-time on HIV, expressed as fractions of FTE corresponding to estimated hours worked on HIV per week out of total hours per week prescribed as full-time for that cadre in the national scheme of service, or other Ministry of Health guidelines.

Report HRH who are actually actively working on services or programs related to HIV at the time of data collection, not including staff who have resigned, absconded, are dismissed, are pending hiring, or are on extended leave (e.g., for graduate studies). Unfilled positions or vacancies should not be included.

If possible, avoid collecting data across a period which spans across a major budgetary change or a health worker graduation and placement period.

i.e. prevention, treatment and other HIV support and are receiving any type of support from PEPFAR at facility sites, community sites, and at the above-site level.

_Not applicable: This indicator is neither a numerator nor a denominator_.

_Definition_

For this indicator, health workers who receive any type of support from PEPFAR, including monetary (i.e., salary, overtime, stipends) and non-monetary support should be counted.

**Monetary**:

PEPFAR monetary support includes any monetary contribution toward a total salary and stipend payments.

**Non-monetary support** includes health workers who are not receiving salary or stipend, but do receive any type of non-currency support for which PEPFAR incurs an expense and that enables a health worker to perform additional HIV-related services. Examples include but are not limited to: mobile phone credits/air time, general modes of transportation such as a bicycle or motorbike, credits for transportation such a bus tokens or cards, job aids or equipment that can be used outside of HIV or in other jobs (such as in private practice), or other in-kind support. Do not include receiving in-service training, receiving routine supportive supervision, clinical mentoring, or any activities as part of continuous quality improvement.

This indicator is the number of full-time equivalent positions (FTE) working on HIV (“HIV FTE”), defined as the time spent on HIV that is supported by the PEPFAR partner, as a proportion of the full-time work week. Calculate part-time positions working exclusively on HIV, or full-time positions working on several areas including HIV and other illnesses, as fractions.  However, do not count any amount of time health workers are already spending on HIV-related services that would happen without PEPFAR support. Only count the hours that are worked in exchange for monetary or non-monetary compensation from a PEFPAR implementing
mechanism. Full time equivalency hours should be the standard listed in the cadre’s scheme of service and/or Ministry of Health guidelines. The methodology for calculating this is consistent with Expenditure Analysis (EA) Guidance.

* For example, four PEPFAR-supported health workers who each work on average 25% of the work week (independent of variations in the hours worked per week by each worker) on HIV would contribute 1.0 FTE.

* PEPFAR may support a doctor’s full salary who works full-time with time distributed among five communities – you would then allocate her time as 0.2 FTEs per site. This would also apply to workers who split their time between community and facility. Only count the year in which PEPFAR expended resources to provide the support; for example, providing a bike for a community worker would only be counted the year the bike was received.
",,,,,"HRH_CURR was previously reported at the facility site and community site levels by type of cadre and type of support. Above site workers are now included in this indicator.

Added new types of staffing support (Salaried staff, Staff receiving Stipends, Staff receiving non-monetary support).
",,Annually,"Many countries experience HRH shortages and/or imbalances by population density (e.g., HRH shortages in rural areas) that are not related to population health needs, including HIV epidemiology; addressing density and distribution of HRH is important in increasing access to HIV services.

In many PEPFAR countries, there are overall shortages of HRH, particularly in rural and remote areas, leading to insufficient numbers of health workers according to internationally recommended levels (2.3 doctors, nurses, midwives/1,000 population). There are also countries where there is large overproduction of health workers, with medical unemployment in urban areas, and at the same time with shortages in rural areas.

Furthermore, different types of health workers receive different types and amounts of support that may vary by geographic location, cadre, workload, and other factors.
Understanding the ways in which different cadres are supported is important for mobilizing differential models of service delivery under different circumstances.

This indicator measures the person-time that PEPFAR-supported health workers contribute to providing HIV services at facility and community sites. It allows us to track our level of support and continuously calibrate it based on impact. It also allows us, over time, to measure the transition from PEPFAR support to host country support.
","Data on total numbers of positions or FTEs supported should be tracked by implementing partner’s record-keeping systems, for example, personnel databases, human resources records, and financial records that show salary or stipend payments, including information on non-monetary support to volunteers. Leverage the same records and systems partners already use to report dollar amounts for EA reporting, to identify PEPFAR support of HRH. Hours worked on HIV may be estimated using staff work-week scheduling calendars and HIV clinic/lab opening hours, and speaking with facility in-charges. For community sites, hours worked on HIV can be estimated using average beneficiary consultation times, and average number of consultations.

For non-monetary supported personnel, partners should cross-reference expense reports and registers against the cadre types who received the corresponding non-monetary benefits. For example, receipts showing transportation allowances were provided to attend meetings could be cross-referenced with the attendance listed in the minutes for community lay workers. Facility and community workers are reported by IM, Site ID, facility and community site affiliation, and cadre type. All PEPFAR-supported workers at the facility and community should be reported.

We recommend that PEPFAR implementing partners following these steps:

1. Identify all facility and community sites where you work.

2. Identify and count the number of health workers (individuals) you support at each site.

3. Group these health workers into their most appropriate, mutually exclusive cadre (doctor, nurse, lay counselor, lab technician).

4. List all types of monetary and non-monetary support that were provided to health workers at any of those sites in the current fiscal year (as incentive or compensation for time spent on HIV services at those sites).

5. Assign those types of support to the health workers identified on your site lists.

Create a matrix of supported health workers by cadre and support type

6. Further split the health workers into sub-groups based on the most appropriate
mutually exclusive type of PEPFAR support. (*Assign FTE to the “highest” category - Non-monetary support should be reported if you provide only non-monetary support, with no salary or stipend

7. Calculate the FTE: Hours per week that this mechanism supports for HIV-related services at this site / Hours in a full-time work week

Repeat this separately for the three types of support:

8. Take the average FTE for each cadre

9. Add up the total FTE within each broader cadre category (clinical, clinical support, management, loy, social service, other)

10. Enter this amount in DATIM in the corresponding box for cadre category – support type.

Above-site support may include Ministry of Health or other government staff who work at the district or provincial level, or at the national level, including Ministry of Health office, National Reference Laboratories, or at national research centers not otherwise providing HIV services directly to beneficiaries.

**Clinical**

* Clinical workers are those who provide a direct clinical service to clients:

* (Clinical professionals, including doctors, nurses, midwives, clinical officers, medical and nursing assistants, auxiliary nurses, auxiliary midwives, testing and counseling providers. They should have completed a diploma or certificate program according to a standardized or accredited curriculum and support or substitute for university-trained professionals.)

**Clinical Support**

* Clinical Support workers are those who support clinical services at the site but do not directly provide services to clients: (Pharmacists, medical technologists, laboratorians, lab and pharmacy technicians)

**Management**

* Management workers are those who provide support to the site for administrative needs but not directly provide services to clients: (Facility administrators, human resource managers, monitoring and evaluation advisors, epidemiologists and other professional staff critical to health service delivery and program support.)

**Social service**

* Social Service workers are those who have advanced training in social services and provide services directly to clients: Social service workers including social workers, child and youth development workers, social welfare assistants.

**Lay**

* Lay workers are those who have non-clinical training and provide services directly to clients: (Health workers who provide important services for the continuum of care within facilities and/or communities. These include (but are not limited to) adherence support, mother mentors, cough monitors, expert clients, lay counselors, peer educators, community health workers and other community-based cadres )

* Other - workers who do not fit into any of the categories above.

**Other**

* For all categories of workers, please provide description of specific cadres in the narrative when reporting.

By cadre category (for above-site)

Management central level

* Management central level are those staff supporting management functions at national level. Examples may be development and implementation of policies, guidelines, quality standards, health or HIV budgeting and financing.  The work of these staff have a national scope and affect all (or multiple) districts or regions.

Management (sub-national unit)

* Management sub-national unit are those staff supporting management functions for one geographic area at the sub-national level. Examples may include district-level health planning and coordination, district-level quality improvement, training or mentoring (e.g. district health office, provincial coordinating authority)

* Faculty (Tutors and Trainers) are those staff working at pre-service institutions and training centers/departments.

Faculty

Epi-surveillance

* Epi/Surveillance staff are those collecting and/or analyzing HIV epidemiologic data at the above site level. This may include making national or district-level estimates of PLHIV or key populations, incidence modeling, ANC or sentinel surveillance, integrated behavioral and biological surveys, drug resistance estimates.

* Other types of staff not covered by the above categories.

Other

By site-level cadre and by type of support provided by PEPFAR to the staff

* For each cadre category supported by PEPFAR at the site level, further disaggregate the HIV FTE by the type of support provided by PEPFAR. The total HIV FTE should equal the sum of the HIV FTE by three types of support. Do not disaggregate above-site cadre category FTE by type of support.

**Salaried staff**

* Salary – _Total number of HIV FTE positions for which PEPFAR is providing any level of financial support toward their regular salary_. Include all HIV FTE (all person-time spent on HIV) if any amount of salary support is provided, even if they also receive support from sources other than PEPFAR. This represents the total FTE that are “touched” by PEPFAR salary support. PEPFAR salary support is any ongoing monetary contribution bench marked toward a total salary which is benchmarked toward, a government salary scale or international salary standard). A salary is characterized by being disbursed at regularly scheduled intervals in expected denominations.

**Staff receiving Stipends**

Stipend – _Total number of HIV FTE positions for which PEPFAR does not provide salary support but does provide monetary payments in connection with the provision of HIV services_. Stipend payments are not necessarily disbursed in regularly scheduled intervals, and are not necessarily commensurate with, nor benchmarked toward, a government salary scale or international salary standard. These include one-time reimbursements for expenses connected to travel or training (per diems); and supplementary payments, for example, for overtime worked due to HIV case burden. Payment could be made at regular intervals depending on agreement. 

**Staff receiving non-monetary support**

Non-monetary only – _Total number of HIV FTE positions for which PEPFAR provides only non-monetary support_. Report if PEPFAR provides only non-monetary forms of support that do not involve currency, in connection with or in support of the provision of HIV services. These include mobile phone credits, meals, general modes of transportation like bicycle or motorbike, job aids or equipment that can be used outside of HIV or in other jobs (such as in private practice), or other in-kind support. Include volunteers who work on HIV and receive only non-monetary support from PEPFAR.

",This indicator can be used as a cross-sectional indicator at Q4. It can be used to better understand our investments in Strategic information; and to support the understanding of data quality for other indicators. Timely access to up-to-date patient information plays a vital role in the provision of effective clinical care by health professionals. Diagnosis and treatment can be improved if health professionals have easy access to accurate and comprehensive medical records of patients.,"* The partner should indicate whether the **PEPFAR-Supported** service delivery areas listed below have implemented and are actively using an electronic medical record system (also known as electronic patient tracking systems). (EMR/EPTS) to assist clinical service provision or for patient or program monitoring and reporting. Specifically for PEPFAR reporting a minimum of 6 months of retrospective data should be included in the EMR. (For example, an ART EMR can be set up in Sept 2016, and contain at least 6 months of retrospective data (current patients that have been enrolled on ART) and can be included for Q4 reporting.

* The partner should indicate whether the **PEPFAR-Supported** service delivery areas listed below have **NOT** implemented an EMR/EPTS

* This should be used if the site has this service delivery area, but the partner does not support these services; OR the site does not include this service (N/A).

**NOTE**: If a service is offered at the site but integrated into another service delivery point do not record N/A, but rather document whether the EMR/EPTS at that site is inclusive of those services (for example this site does not have PEPFAR funded targets for the service delivery area).

Definition of an Electronic Medical Record (EMR):

An EMR/EPTS is a **_longitudinal_** electronic record of an individual patient's health information that can assist health professionals with decision-making and treatment. Data found in a record may include patient demographics, past medical history, vital signs, examination and progress notes, medications, allergies, immunizations, laboratory test results, other test results. It can also support the collection of data for other uses such as quality management, public health disease surveillance and reporting. < WHO: Global Observatory for eHealth > EMR can include real-time point-of-care data entry as well as retrospective data entry. An electronic medical record (EMR) is a digital version of a paper chart that contains key information in a patient’s medical history from one service delivery point or site.

Individual SDP EMR versus Integrated Health EMR:

EMRs are typically for all health areas, but PEPFAR is interested in better understanding whether EMRs are available for the service delivery areas where PEPFAR focusses its work (presented in the disaggregation below). If a service delivery area is incorporated in a larger integrated health EMR, then it should be included this indicator. If two or more service areas are in an integrated EMR, both areas should be included in this indicator. A site service delivery area should be included in this indicator if the EMR is on site (Server and Computer entry screen or there is a central server at a hub facility, that includes all data from all the “spokes” for that facility’s catchment area. As long as the data for patient management and reporting comes from the EMR system as one source.

Registries: Some sites maintain types of e-Register (which might provide basic functionality like reporting, default tracing, etc), however, if they do not capture **_longitudinal_** clinical information, they should not be included in this indicator.

","If a site does not report ART (PEPFAR-supported ART site), then it should not be included as having a function-able, working ART EMR; but should be included in N/A. Number of service delivery area with an EMR should not exceed the number of service delivery areas
reporting results/targets.
","This indicator can be used as a cross-sectional indicator at Q4, to determine the number of function-able, working EMR supporting clinical management and data reporting in the
PEPFAR- support sites.

    * See ""how to collect""",,,"As an above site indicator, the PEPFAR support categories of DSD and TA-SDI do not apply. To report results for this indicator, it is expected that PEPFAR provides support to the HIV service delivery area. PEPFAR does NOT have to have supported the development of the EMR at the site to be counted. EMRs supported by other donors or Ministries of
Health should be included in this indicator. It is highly recommended that service delivery areas that have functional EMRs use these both for patient management as well as reporting.

**Definition : what is a PEPFAR supported site for the purpose of this indicator**:

A “PEPFAR supported site” for the purpose of this indicator should include any facility site in the PEPFAR master facility list in DATIM which also reported any programmatic target or result during the same reporting period.

A PEPFAR-supported facility-based service delivery point uses PEPFAR funds to provide HIV-related services. It offers one or more HIV-related services including but not limited to: HIV testing and counseling; prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT); anti-retroviral treatment (ART) and TB/HIV services. Examples include different HIV services within clinics, hospitals, health facilities and community-based organizations (government, private or NGO). These can also include fixed locations and/or mobile operations offering routine and/or regularly scheduled services.

PEPFAR service delivery points for EMR integration include the following:

1. HIV Testing services –includes counselling (pre-test information and post-test counselling); linkage to appropriate HIV services; and coordination with laboratory services to support quality assurance and the delivery of correct results.

2. Treatment services – this includes services where ART is initiated and monitored.

3. Antenatal/maternity services– HIV Testing and treatment in an ANC and/or maternity setting

4. EID services – HIV testing and care for infants of HIV positive women, often linked to <5 children services and/or maternity services, but can also be part of an ART clinic, but with its own EMR EID

5. TB/HIV services – includes routine screening, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of TB among PLWHA or routine HIV testing and counseling and appropriate referral in persons with TB

If services are integrated, for example EID as part of the Treatment services, then as long as EID is captured in the treatment services EMR or a separate EMR for EID is available
within these services, then this would be counted as an EID EMR as well.

","Annually
","This indicator identifies which PEPFAR-supported laboratories and blood centers/banks are, or are not, actively engaged in an international, national, or regionally-recognized process for CQI and demonstrating measured improvement towards accreditation.

A PEPFAR-supported laboratory or blood center/bank is defined as: A laboratory is defined as:

A. Having dedicated physical laboratory infrastructure

B. Having dedicated trained laboratory professionals performing testing.

C. Conducting laboratory testing in one or more of the following areas:

    a. Diagnosis of HIV infection with EIA or molecular methods

    b. HIV care and treatment monitoring with CD4 testing or HIV viral load

    c. Early Infant Diagnosis (EID)

    i. TB diagnostics

   g. Malaria infection diagnostics

    k. STI diagnostics

    l. OI (Opportunistic Infection) diagnostics, including _Cryptococcal_ antigen 

Note: A laboratory, as define above, that uses POCT type assays (such as the Pima or rapid diagnostic tests) are to be counted as a laboratory.

_Blood centers/banks_:

A. Performs any service involved in blood donor recruitment, blood and plasma collection, testing, processing, storage, and distribution of blood and blood products.

B. Blood banks/centers may exist within a laboratory and should be counted as a laboratory.

A laboratory or blood center/bank should be counted for engaged activities supported by a recognized external CQI or accreditation preparedness program which is a national or regionally-recognized continuous quality improvement process towards meeting international standards. For laboratories, accreditation program may be a stepwise laboratory quality improvement approach such as WHO AFRO Stepwise Laboratory Quality Improvement Process Towards Accreditation (SLIPTA) and CDC/PAHO Caribbean Laboratory Quality Management System Stepwise Improvement Process towards Accreditation (CDC/PAHO LQMS-SIP). For blood centers/banks this may be participation in an internationally-recognized accreditation program such as the African Society for Blood Transfusion (AfSBT).

Laboratories enrolled and have achieved the minimum level of recognition (audit score) in a nationally or regionally-recognized continuous quality improvement program using the country or region’s equivalent to the WHO AFRO SLIPTA Checklist (i.e., a laboratory with at least one star on the WHO AFRO SLIPTA checklist or at least tier one level of the CDC/PAHO LQMS-SIP checklist) by a qualified external auditor. Similar organizations or bodies in other regions or countries may issue this recognition under their respective continuous quality improvement program. While enrollment in a CQI program is critical, all laboratories are not expected to be accredited.

Full accreditation is achieved when the laboratory or Blood bank/center is recognized by an accrediting organization as to meeting the standards to achieve full accreditation. Accreditation must be maintained and not expired to be counted.

Countries are encouraged to monitor the number of laboratories and testing sites performing HIV-related testing as well as the capacity of these sites. This effort seeks to evaluate PEPFAR support for laboratory capacity that will provide access to high quality, rapid, affordable diagnostic tests for care, treatment, prevention, and surveillance for HIV/AIDS.

Participation in PT programs can help monitor and improve the quality of HIV-related testing at the testing sites. This indicator will encourage countries to implement a PT program if none exists, expand the PT program to cover all HIV testing sites, and will help improve quality of diagnostic and monitoring testing at all sites. The PT program is not intended to be punitive; the PT data is used for targeted technical assistance and improving overall quality of testing.

The purpose is to determine the following:

1. Laboratories and blood centers/banks that are doing the HIV-related testing

2. Laboratories and blood centers/banks that are participating in a PT program specific for each test.

3. Laboratories and blood centers/banks achieving successful passing criteria on the most recent PT panel. This will be specific to each test, as specified in the disaggregation.

Medication assisted therapy programs should be an access point for PWID and the program should refer and link to ARV treatment programs, PMTCT for female PWID and a range of other prevention services.

It is important to know how many people are reached in order to monitor how well programs are reaching PWIDs with medication-assisted treatment. This information can be used to plan and make decisions on how well the PWID audience is being reached with medication-assisted treatment. If a small percentage of the intended audience is being reached, then it would be recommended that activities are adjusted to improve reach. If a large percentage of the intended audience is being reached, then headquarter staff would want to take these lessons learned and disseminate them to other countries. The country can use the information to improve upon the quality of the program as well as scale-up successful models.

The risk of mother-to-child transmission can be significantly reduced by providing ARVs for the mother during pregnancy and delivery, with antiretroviral prophylaxis for the infant, and antiretroviral medicines to the mother or child if breastfeeding, and the use of safe delivery practices and safer infant feeding. The data will be used to track progress towards global and national goals of eliminating mother-to-child transmission; to inform policy and strategic planning; for advocacy; and for leveraging resources for accelerated scale-up. It will help measure trends in coverage of antiretroviral prophylaxis and treatment, and when disaggregated by regimen type, will also assess progress in implementing more effective antiretroviral therapy regimens. As the indicator usually measures ARVs dispensed and not those consumed, it is not possible to determine adherence to the regimen in most cases.

The risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) can be significantly reduced by providing ARVs to the mother during pregnancy, delivery and (if applicable) breastfeeding. This indicator provides information on coverage of the first step in the prevention of mother-to- child transmission (PMTCT) cascade. High coverage enables early initiation of care and treatment for HIV-positive mothers. The total number of identified HIV-positive women provides the facility-specific number of pregnant women with HIV to start a facility-based PMTCT cascade.

_Numerator_: Count all women who were enrolled in ANC during the 12-month reporting period whose HIV status is known positive, or who received an HIV test result (positive or negative) during ANC. Reconcile with all women in the L&D register who whose date of delivery was in the 12 months reporting period and whose HIV status at L&D was known positive, or who received an HIV test result (positive or negative) at ANC or L&D to avoid double counting.

The numerator is a composite of the following two data components:

1. The number of women with known (positive) HIV infection attending ANC for a new pregnancy over the last reporting period

2. The number of women attending ANC, L&D who were tested for HIV and received results

The numerator can be summed from categories a-d below:

a. Number of pregnant women with unknown HIV status attending ANC who received an HIV test and result during the current pregnancy

b. Pregnant women with known HIV infection attending ANC for a new pregnancy

c. Number of pregnant women with unknown HIV status attending L&D who received an HIV test and result during their current pregnancy

d. Women with unknown HIV status attending postpartum services within 72 hours of delivery who were tested for the first time in the current pregnancy and received results.

A “status” is defined as a confirmed test result from a test during this pregnancy (either positive or negative) or already known HIV infection at antenatal clinic entry. An indeterminate test result should not be counted or reported as a part of this indicator.

_For the denominator_: Count all women who were enrolled in ANC during the 12-month reporting period OR delivered at the facility (recorded in the L&D register), reconciling the latter with the former using the ANC No. to avoid double counting.

As per global guidance (see GARPR indicator 3.4, link above), it is expected that the national program can reconcile information collected from ANC with L&D records. However in MER
2.0 the PEPFAR indicator for PMTCT_ART has been simplified to collect information only at antenatal care (ANC) sites to better align with 2016 WHO Consolidated ARV guidelines, reduce burden on data collection, and improve data quality. Therefore in reporting this indicator PEPFAR operating units should 1) utilize the national system whether it is able avoid double counting or not and are not expected to collect or report this information through a separate system 2) if it this is not possible to report individuals from both ANC and L&D, please include an explanation in the narrative whether the data is from ANC, L&D and/or both.

Studies have also shown that early initiation, regardless of an individual’s CD4 cell count, can enhance treatment benefits and save lives, and WHO currently recommends treatment for all. The percentage of adults and children receiving antiretroviral therapy among all adults and children living with HIV provides a benchmark for monitoring global targets over time, and comparing progress across countries.

Diagnosed is the first 90 of the global targets. To ensure people living with HIV receive the care and treatment required to live healthy, productive lives, and to reduce the chance of transmitting HIV, it is critical that they know their status.

There are multiple methods to estimate the number of people living with HIV who know their status.

* Case-based surveillance

* In countries with well-functioning HIV reporting systems, the number of people diagnosed can be estimated from national case-based data. The number of deaths among PLHIV must be subtracted from the cumulative number diagnosed to calculate the number of people living with HIV who know their status.

* Survey-based reporting

    * Certain population-based surveys include questions about known HV status. Although this information may be subject to under-reporting bias, when combined with survey-related HIV testing it can provide an estimate of known status among survey respondents.

    * Many population-based surveys include questions on HIV testing history. These questions can provide a range for the proportion of PLHIV with known status. The percentage of people living with HIV in the survey who have been tested in the past 12 months and received the results provides the upper range of known status (there will be a small proportion equal to the annual incidence rate – less than 2% in most cases – of people who might have converted in the 12 months after being tested). The percentage of people living with HIV in the survey who have ever been tested and received the results provides the lower range of known status.

* When using survey-based methods, note that:

    * Household surveys are often restricted to respondents of reproductive age (15– 49), and so may not be representative of people living with HIV

    * <15 years and

    * >49 years.

    * Because household surveys are typically only done every five years, data from non-recent surveys may not reflect current levels of testing coverage.

Viral suppression is the third and last 90 of the global target, and the ultimate goal of the HIV treatment cascade. Patients on ART who achieve and maintain viral suppression minimize their risk of disease progression and HIV transmission. Viral suppression is a critical quality of service quality; unsuppressed viral load can be indicative of suboptimal treatment adherence, and can lead to the development and spread of drug resistance.

Subnational data will not be collected for FY16, but subnational collection will start for FY17 data collection.",Annually,,"_Numerator_: The numerator can be generated by counting the number of adults and children receiving antiretroviral therapy at the end of the reporting period. Count the patient if, during the reporting months, viral load has been recorded and is <1000 copies/mL. For countries with other thresholds (e.g. undetectable <50 copies/ml or
<400 copies/ml), preliminary evidence from several studies suggests the proportion of those with 50 copies/ml or above and less than 1000 copies/ml is small, so no adjustment is required. The testing threshold value should be reported in the narrative for countries with thresholds other than <1000 copies/ml.

Viral-load testing should be routine rather than episodic; for example, when treatment failure is suspected. If multiple viral-load tests are done annually for a person, only the last routine test result should be reported. Results from episodic viral loads should not be reported. If viral-load testing coverage is less than 75% of those receiving antiretroviral therapy in the reporting year, results should be interpreted with caution.

Tools for measuring viral load may vary across countries. Routine viral-load suppression tests from clinical and program data should be reported where available. In countries where such data are not available, results from HIV population-based surveys or drug-resistance surveys based on a random sample of people on antiretroviral therapy may be reported. Countries should report the source of the numerator and denominator data, and data from both sources should be reported if available, although clinical and program data are preferred. If results from a survey are used, that should be included when reporting.

Where clinical and program data are available from routine monitoring systems, results will be recorded in patient files or in a laboratory system. Data should be de- duplicated where patients receive multiple viral-load tests in a year.

If an HIV population-based or drug-resistance survey is used in place of routine program monitoring data, measurement of viral load should be done for the entire population of HIV- positive individuals where ARV is detected in specimens. Self- reported treatment status has been shown to be of limited quality. Therefore, viral- load estimates among those who report receiving antiretroviral therapy should not be used.

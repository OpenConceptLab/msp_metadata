To ensure people living with HIV receive the care and treatment required to live healthy, productive lives, and to reduce the chance of transmitting HIV, it is critical that they know their status. In many countries, targeting testing and counselling at locations and populations with the highest HIV burden will be the most efficient way to reach people living with HIV and ensure they are aware of their status. This indicator captures the efficacy and coverage of HIV testing interventions. 

This indicator is harmonized with GARPR indicator 1.5 (https://aidsreportingtool.unaids.org/static/docs/GARPR_Guidelines_2016_EN.pdf). 

Numerator: 
There are multiple methods to estimate the number of people living with HIV who know their status. 
* Case-based surveillance: In countries with well-functioning HIV reporting systems, the number of people diagnosed can be estimated from national case- based data. The number of deaths among PLHIV must be subtracted from the cumulative number diagnosed to calculate the number of people living with HIV who know their status. 
* Survey-based reporting: 
    * Certain population-based surveys include questions about known HV status. Although this information may be subject to under-reporting bias, when combined with survey-related HIV testing it can provide an estimate of known status among survey respondents. 
    * Many population-based surveys include questions on HIV testing history. These questions can provide a range for the proportion of PLHIV with known status. The percentage of people living with HIV in the survey who have been tested in the past 12 months and received the results provides the upper range of known status (there will be a small proportion equal to the annual incidence rate – less than 2% in most cases – of people who might have converted in the 12 months after being tested). The percentage of people living with HIV in the survey who have ever been tested and received the results provides the lower range of known status. 
    * When using survey-based methods, note that: 
        * Household surveys are often restricted to respondents of reproductive age (15– 49), and so may not be representative of people living with HIV <15 years and >49 years. 
        * Because household surveys are typically only done every five years, data from non-recent surveys may not reflect current levels of testing coverage.",,,,,,This data should be entered in DATIM by the USG country team.,Not required.,,"1.

It can be used to better understand PEPFAR’s investments in Strategic information and to support a broader understanding of data quality challenges for other indicators. Timely access to up-to- date patient information plays a vital role in the provision of effective clinical care by health professionals. Diagnosis and treatment can be improved if health professionals have easy access to accurate and comprehensive medical records of patients.,"The implementing partner should indicate whether the PEPFAR-Supported service delivery areas have implemented and are actively using an electronic medical record system to assist clinical service provision or patient/program monitoring and reporting. Specifically, for PEPFAR reporting a minimum of 6 months of retrospective data should be included in the EMR. (For example, an ART EMR set up in September 2018 to contain at least 6 months of retrospective data (current patients that have been enrolled on ART) could be counted in the reporting at FY18 APR. 

**For example**, if services are integrated, for example EID as part of the Treatment services, then as long as EID is captured in the treatment services EMR or a separate EMR for EID is available within these services, then this would be counted as an EID EMR as well. 

**Definition of an Electronic Medical Record (EMR):** 
An EMR is a longitudinal electronic record of an individual patient's health information that can assist health professionals with decision-making and treatment. Data found in a record may include patient demographics, past medical history, vital signs, examination and progress notes, medications, allergies, immunizations, laboratory test results, other test results. It can also support the collection of data for other uses such as quality management, public health disease surveillance and reporting. < WHO: Global Observatory for eHealth > EMR can include real-time point-of-care data entry as well as retrospective data entry. An electronic medical record (EMR) is a digital version of a paper chart that contains key information in a patient’s medical history from one service delivery point or site. 

**Individual service delivery area/point EMR versus Integrated Health EMR:** 
EMRs are typically for all health areas, but PEPFAR is interested in better understanding whether EMRs are available for the service delivery areas where PEPFAR focusses its work (presented in the disaggregation below). If a service delivery area is incorporated in a larger integrated health EMR, then it should be included this indicator. If two or more service areas are in an integrated EMR, both areas should be included in this indicator. A site service delivery area should be included in this indicator if the EMR is on site (Server and Computer entry screen or there is a central server at a hub facility, that includes all data from all the “spokes” for that facility’s catchment area. As long as the data for patient management and reporting comes from the EMR system as one source. 

**Registries:** Some sites maintain types of e-Registers (which might provide basic functionality like reporting, default tracing, etc.). However, **if these e-Registers do not capture longitudinal clinical information, they should not be included in this indicator.**","If a site does not report ART (PEPFAR-supported ART site), then it should not be included as having an ART EMR.

**What is a PEPFAR supported site for the purpose of this indicator?** 
A “PEPFAR supported site” for the purpose of this indicator should include any facility in the PEPFAR master facility list in DATIM which also reported any programmatic target or result during the same reporting period. 

**What is a PEPFAR-Supported Service Delivery area at a site for the purpose of this indicator?** 
A PEPFAR-supported facility-based service delivery area uses PEPFAR funds to provide HIV-related services at service delivery points within the facility. It offers one or more HIV-related services including but not limited to: HIV testing and counseling; prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT); anti-retroviral treatment (ART) and TB/HIV services. Examples include different HIV services within clinics, hospitals, health facilities and community-based organizations (government, private or NGO).

It captures information about whether FP integration is occurring at various HIV service delivery points within PEPFAR supported sites. Many PEPFAR sites will have numerous service delivery points within each site. For example, if one hospital receives PEPFAR support for both the HIV treatment department AND the ANC department, then the FPINT_SITE total for that one site is 2 service delivery points. 

This indicator will enable PEPFAR stakeholders to: 
* Gain a basic, but essential, understanding of whether FP services are being integrated in PEPFAR-supported service delivery points. 
* Identify gaps, including service contexts, countries, or regions with low levels of HIV/FP integration. 

Inherent within this indicator is the principle that integrated HIV/FP program activities must respect a client’s right to make informed decisions about his or her reproductive life. This means that clients should have access to an appropriate and comprehensive range of contraceptive options; and/or to safer conception/pregnancy counseling depending upon their fertility desire and intentions. Judgements and personal opinions are not appropriate in a clinic setting. 

This indicator will be used to monitor coverage of HIV/FP integration at a global level. _**Therefore, detailed information on completion of referrals, FP service uptake, types of contraceptive methods offered on site, and other critical components of integrated programs will not be captured through this indicator, but should be maintained at the site or programmatic level.**_","Definition: Voluntary Family Planning Service Provision 
To be considered as a PEPFAR-supported service delivery point that directly provides fully integrated voluntary FP services, all 3 criteria below must be met. If a service delivery point provides fewer than 3 of the services noted below, it should not be counted under this indicator. 

The PEPFAR-supported HIV service delivery point must provide for all relevant clients, including partners in HIV discordant couples (as documented by standard operating procedures, guidelines, protocols, manuals and/or intake documents, etc.): 
1. Assessment of voluntary FP needs through routine screening; 
2. Provision of voluntary FP counseling (including safe pregnancy counseling for those wishing to become pregnant, or those who are pregnant); 
3. Provision or referral of a broad range of modern contraceptive methods, in accordance with the National FP policy guidelines, for clients who voluntarily wish to delay or prevent pregnancy. It is very much preferred for methods to be available onsite. If referrals are given, they must include detailed information (e.g., facility location, hours of operation, etc.) about where methods can be accessed. 

Assess Voluntary Family Planning Needs Through Screening (Number 1 above): In assessing FP needs, all clients as part of their routine care visit should be asked about their FP needs and practices. Depending upon the individual client and his or her needs, these can include: reproductive goals; prior pregnancies; living and family situation; FP knowledge; previously used FP methods and satisfaction with use; and any FP-related concerns. These needs should be assessed without expressing any personal biases about a client’s preference. 

Provide Voluntary Family Planning Counseling (including Safe Pregnancy Counseling) (Number 2 above): Quality voluntary FP counseling should cover a wide range of topics that are client and context specific, and that include both safe pregnancy counseling for individuals who wish to become pregnant as well as contraception for individuals who wish to avoid, space or delay pregnancy. “FP counseling” is not the same as ""FP education"". Depending upon the type of FP services that are offered at PEPFAR supported site; health providers or community mobilizers may provide EDUCATION and/or COUNSELING on FP. 

Education activities may include distribution of printed materials, group health education and community outreach efforts among other interventions. Education helps to increase general knowledge on the benefits and importance of FP and increase support for FP use, as well as to link women and their partners to other FP services, including contraceptive method provision. 

FP counseling is an interpersonal communication between the health provider and client where topics specific to the clients’ needs are discussed to help them determine if they want to use FP and if so; to help them choose and use the FP method of their choice. HIV service providers or all levels can be trained and supported to develop or improve their skills at FP counseling. A wide array of FP counseling materials exist that can be used in PEPFAR settings; including national FP flipcharts, counseling cards and informational handouts Voluntary FP counseling should follow the standards and best practices outlined in the “Additional References” section below. 

Provision or Referral of a Broad Range of Modern Contraceptive Methods (Number 3 above): Per U.S. Government legislation, and in line with national FP policies, a broad range of methods should be provided to clients, allowing them to choose the method most appropriate for them, either directly or through referral. For an SDP to be counted towards this indicator, at least three modern contraceptive methods should be available either on site or through referral. Emergency contraception is an important FP method that should be available in all HIV settings as part of FP and gender based violence (GBV) services. Information on modern contraceptive methods can be found in the references listed at the end of this sheet. All referrals should include detailed information about where methods can be accessed (e.g., facility location, operating hours, etc.). 

PEPFAR-Supported Service Delivery Point at a site 
A PEPFAR-supported service delivery point uses PEPFAR funds to directly provide HIV- related services. It offers one or more HIV-related services including but not limited to: HIV testing and counseling; prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT); anti-retroviral treatment (ART); screening and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections (OI); other health services for people living with HIV (e.g., positive health, dignity and prevention (PHDP), nutrition support, etc.), and prevention activities for priority populations (key populations and adolescent girls and young women). It can include fixed locations and/or mobile operations offering routine and/or regularly scheduled services. Examples include different HIV services within clinics, hospitals, health facilities and community-based organizations (government, private or NGO). Individual community health workers are not considered to be individual service delivery points. Rather, the organizations with which they are affiliated are considered to be the service delivery point(s). 
PEPFAR service delivery points for FP/HIV integration include the following: 
1. Care and Treatment (including Pediatric and Adolescent Care and Treatment Services) – this includes services where ART is initiated and monitored. 
2. Antenatal and/or Maternity services - this includes FP education and healthy timing and spacing messages in the ANC setting (when a woman in pregnant and receiving PMTCT services and/or FP counseling and method provision post- partum.) 
3. Priority Population Prevention services – this includes priority population programming, such as drop in centers and prevention sites focused on adolescent girls and young women (i.e., DREAMS). FP integration can also take place across the clinical cascade for priority populations, including care and treatment which would be recorded under care and treatment service delivery point 
4. Key Population Prevention services – this includes programming for Men who have sex with men, Transgender people, Sex workers, and People who inject drugs, such as drop in centers. FP integration can also take place across the clinical cascade for key populations, including care and treatment which would be recorded under care and treatment service delivery point. 
5. HIV Testing services - includes counselling (pre-test information and post-test counselling); linkage to appropriate HIV services; and coordination with laboratory services to support quality assurance and the delivery of correct results. FP services can be made available with HIV testing services, especially for key populations and adolescent girls and young women as well as for HIV serodiscordant couples. (even if FP integration is targeting key or priority populations, if occurring in HTS the integration should be documented under HTS) 

**Special Considerations:** 
USG-supported FP and HIV/AIDS programs must adhere to the following principles: 
* People living with HIV (PLHIV) and their partners should be provided with information on, and be able to exercise voluntary choices about their health, including their reproductive health. 
* The USG, including PEPFAR, supports a person‘s right to choose, as a matter of principle, the number, timing, and spacing of their children, as well as use of FP methods, regardless of HIV/AIDS status. 
* FP use should always be a choice, made freely and voluntarily, independent of the person‘s HIV status. 
* The decision to use or not to use FP should be free of any discrimination, judgment, stigma, coercion, duress, or deceit and informed by accurate, comprehensible information and access to a variety of methods. 
* Access to and provision of health services, including antiretroviral treatment, for PLHIV should never be conditioned on that person's choice to accept or reject any other service, such as family planning (other than what may be necessary to ensure the safe use of antiretroviral treatment and other drug interactions). 
* PLHIV who wish to have children should have access to safe and non-judgmental pregnancy counseling services.","Data should be reviewed regularly for the purposes of program management including monitoring progress towards achieving targets, and identifying and correcting any data quality issues. Follow PEPFAR Guidance for data quality review as circulated in Q4 reporting guidance.

* To determine the number of individuals that are suffering from GBV and reporting to clinical partners 
* To assess whether post-GBV clinical services are being used. 
* Gain an understanding of the uptake of post-GBV clinical services offered across PEPFAR countries. 
* Provide important information to key stakeholders about PEPFAR programs that mitigate women and girls’ and other marginalized populations’ vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. 
* Support efforts to assess the impact of post-GBV clinical services by correlating the reach (i.e., number of people served) of these services over time with outcomes related to GBV (and HIV/AIDS), as described through other data collection efforts such as survey data (DHS/PHIA/VACS). 
* Identify programmatic gaps by analyzing the number and ages of people receiving services, as well as the reach of services in particular geographic areas.","Data sources are standard program monitoring tools, such as forms, log books, spreadsheets and databases that national programs and /or partners develop or already use. 

Data should be collected continuously at the point of service delivery (i.e., ANC, PMTCT, ART, etc.) and aggregated in time for PEPFAR reporting cycles. 

The indicator can be generated by counting the number of persons receiving post-GBV clinical care, disaggregated by the age group and sex of the client receiving the service, as well as the type of service (sexual violence or emotional/physical violence) and PEP provision (see below for disaggregation information). 

To adequately capture the provision of these services, logs and monitoring forms will need to be used wherever the services are offered. These forms will need to track both the outcome of the initial assessment and the provision of referrals or services. For PEP specifically, registries should collect both the administration of the PEP as well as its completion and the patient’s adherence. 

**Special considerations:** As outlined in the Program Guide for Integrating GBV Prevention and Response in PEPFAR Programs all programs seeking to address GBV must first and foremost protect the dignity, rights, and well-being of those at risk for, and survivors of, GBV. There are four fundamental principles for integrating a GBV response into existing programs and specific actions for putting these principles into practice. These principles are as follows:

In many PEPFAR countries, there are overall shortages of HRH, particularly in rural and remote areas, leading to insufficient numbers of health workers according to internationally recommended levels (2.3 doctors, nurses, midwives/1,000 population). There are also countries where there is large overproduction of health workers, with medical unemployment in urban areas, and at the same time with shortages in rural areas. 

Furthermore, different types of health workers receive different types and amounts of support that may vary by geographic location, cadre, workload, and other factors. Understanding the ways in which different cadres are supported is important for mobilizing differential models of service delivery under different circumstances. 

This indicator measures the person-time that PEPFAR-supported health workers contribute to providing HIV services at facility and community sites. It allows us to track our level of support and continuously calibrate it based on impact. It also allows us, over time, to measure the transition from PEPFAR support to host country support.","Data on total numbers of positions or FTEs supported should be tracked by implementing partner’s record-keeping systems, for example, personnel databases, human resources records, and financial records that show salary or stipend payments, including information on non-monetary support to volunteers. Leverage the same records and systems partners already use to report dollar amounts for EA reporting, to identify PEPFAR support of HRH. Hours worked on HIV may be estimated using staff work-week scheduling calendars and HIV clinic/lab opening hours, and speaking with facility in-charges. For community sites, hours worked on HIV can be estimated using average beneficiary consultation times, and average number of consultations. 

For non-monetary supported personnel, partners should cross-reference expense reports and registers against the cadre types who received the corresponding non- monetary benefits. For example, receipts showing transportation allowances were provided to attend meetings could be cross-referenced with the attendance listed in the minutes for community lay workers. 

Facility and community workers are reported by IM, Site ID, facility and community site affiliation, and cadre type. All PEPFAR-supported workers at the facility and community should be reported. 

We recommend that PEPFAR implementing partners following these steps: 
1) Identify all facility and community sites where you work. 
2) Identify and count the number of health workers (individuals) you support at each site. 
3) Group these health workers into their most appropriate, mutually exclusive cadre (doctor, nurse, lay counselor, lab technician).
4) List all types of monetary and non-monetary support that were provided to health workers at any of those sites in the current fiscal year (as incentive or compensation for time spent on HIV services at those sites). 
5) Assign those types of support to the health workers identified on your site lists. 

Create a matrix of supported health workers by cadre and support type:  

6) Further split the health workers into sub-groups based on the most appropriate mutually exclusive type of PEPFAR support. (*Assign FTE to the “highest” category - Non-monetary support should be reported if you provide only non- monetary support, with no salary or stipend
7)  Calculate the FTE: Hours per week that this mechanism supports for HIV-related services at this site / Hours in a full-time work week 

Repeat this separately for the three types of support:

The lack of a sufficient workforce in countries presents a serious challenge to every area of health. The data will tell us the number of new health workers who are available to enter the health workforce each year as a result of PEPFAR support.,"Training under this indicator is defined as “pre-service” training – the training of “new” health workers (see definition below). Training generally occurs prior to the individual entering the health workforce in his or her new position (with the exception of certain training that may occur on-the job but that prepares health workers to function as a new cadre or with an expanded scope of practice in the health system). A health worker who advances to a higher cadre (e.g., a clinical assistant who completes training to become a clinical officer) shall be counted as a “new” health worker for the purposes of this indicator. The HRH goal is to expand the number of workers in the workforce and increase access to care through the advancement of current workers to higher level cadres through additional training and education. 

Pre-service training institutions are university-based or affiliated schools of medicine, nursing, public health, social work, laboratory science, pharmacy, and other health- related fields. Non-professional or paraprofessional training would be any accredited and nationally recognized pre-service program that is a requirement for this cadre’s entry into the workforce. 

“In-service” and “continuing education” training should not be included in the count for this indicator, but continue to be encouraged. These types of training may be captured by other indicators within program areas (e.g., supply chain). 

In order to count the duration of training must meet or exceed a minimum of 6 months. For example, community health workers who receive a 3-month training course cannot be counted here. The training duration may be a combination of classroom and practical field time to arrive at six months. 

A pre-service training program must be nationally accredited, or at the minimum meet national and international standards. The program must also have specific learning objectives, a course curriculum, expected knowledge, skills, and competencies to be gained by participants, as well as documented minimum requirements for course completion. The duration and intensity of training will vary by cadre; however, all training programs should have at a minimum the criteria listed above. 

Individuals may be in training over many reporting periods; however, only participants who have successfully completed their training should be counted. 

Successful completion of training may be documented by diploma, certificate or other evidence of completion of the program and subsequent eligibility to enter service. 

Individuals not meeting these documented requirements should not be counted in this indicator. 

“Health workers” refers to individuals involved in safeguarding and contributing to the prevention, promotion and protection of the health of the population (both professional and auxiliary-professionals). The categories below describe the different types of health workers to be considered under this indicator. This is not an exhaustive list of all health workers and position titles may vary from country to country. For the purposes of this indicator, health workers may include the following but is not limited to: 
* Clinical professionals, including doctors, nurses, midwives, laboratory scientists, pharmacists, medical technologists, and psychologists. They usually have a tertiary education and most countries have a formal method of certifying their qualifications. 
* Clinical officers, medical and nursing assistants, lab and pharmacy technicians, auxiliary nurses, auxiliary midwives, T&C counselors. They should have completed a diploma or certificate program according to a standardized or accredited curriculum and support or substitute for university-trained professionals. 
* Workers in a health ministry, hospital and facility administrators, human resource managers, monitoring and evaluation advisors, epidemiologists and other professional staff critical to health service delivery and program support. 
* Social service workers including social workers, child and youth development workers, social welfare assistants. 

PEPFAR support includes funding in the areas of curriculum development, teacher training and support, tuition/scholarships, infrastructure, materials/equipment, and practica/internships. For example, full or partial support of student tuition or scholarships, teacher salaries, and expansion/refurbishment of pre-service training facilities could all count under this indicator depending on the investment.

HIV/AIDS has placed significant demands on the already constrained health workforce in many low-income countries. The rapid scale-up of ART is placing additional demands on the health workforce. 

In the majority of PEPFAR countries, there are overall shortages of HRH, particularly in rural and remote areas, leading to insufficient numbers of health workers according to internationally recommended levels (2.3 doctors, nurses, midwives/1,000 population). Many countries experience HRH shortages and/or imbalances by population densities (e.g., HRH shortages in rural areas) that are not related to population health needs, including HIV epidemiology. Addressing density, distribution, and overall utilization of HRH is important in increasing access to HIV services. 

This indicator allows PEPFAR to analyze the availability of staff to provide HIV services at PEPFAR supported facilities. Data should be reviewed against site target achievement and investment. The first year of data collection will serve as an Integral benchmark for continued analysis. 

Teams can also look at this indicator in conjunction with HRH_CURR that captures number of PEPFAR supported workers at PEPFAR-supported sites. This will allow PEPFAR to conduct analysis to determine if the number of PEPFAR-supported staff is appropriate vis-à-vis the number of other staff at the facility providing HIV services. 

There is no universal benchmark against which to measure these data and no ideal PEPFAR to non-PEPFAR ratio.

FY18 (v2.2),HTS_SELF,Concept,PEPFAR,MER,HTS_SELF,Reference Indicator,FY18,v2.2,Knowing HIV Status,Number of individual HIV self-test kits distributed,Number of individual HIV self-test kits distributed,This indicator aims to monitor trends in the distribution of HIV self-test kits within a country at the lowest distribution point.,N/A,N/A,* This is a new indicator for MER 2.0 (version 2.2) and OUs are required to report on it during FY18 if they support the procurement and/or distribution of HIV self-test kits.,Facility & Community,Quarterly,"This is the first MER indicator to monitor PEPFAR programming of HIV self-testing approaches and distribution HIV self-test kits. 

HIV self-testing refers to a process in which a person collects his or her own specimen (oral fluid or blood), performs an HIV test, and then interprets the results. This is often done in a private setting, either alone or with a trusted person. HIV self-testing is a **screening test** and requires self-testers with a reactive (preliminary positive) result to receive further testing from a trained provider using a validated national testing algorithm. HIV self-testing approaches range from unassisted self-testing (with limited or no instruction provided) to directly assisted self-testing (where a testing provider demonstrates how to use the self-test kit). Self-test kits can be distributed in various ways (i.e., by providers or outreach workers, over-the-counter, etc.). Secondary distribution of HIV self-test kits may also occur (e.g., to partners of ANC attendees, or clients of FSWs) 

This indicator aims to monitor trends in the distribution of HIV self-test kits within a country at the lowest distribution point (i.e., between the distributer and the intended user(s)/recipient). The implementation of HIV self-testing programs should facilitate and enhance access to and uptake of HIV testing services for populations where HIV test uptake is low and undiagnosed HIV infection is high (i.e., men, adolescents/young adults, and key populations).","The suggested data source is a (newly developed) HIVST (HIV self-test) register or logbook. This will minimize any potential confusion with HTS_TST data collection and reporting since HIV self-testing is only a screening test and should not be reported under HTS_TST which only includes diagnostic testing. If a standalone HIVST register or logbook is not possible, revise existing HTS registers, log books, and reporting forms already in use to include very clear labels to indicate self-testing to prevent information entered in an HTS register from being counted and reported under HTS_TST or HTS_TST_POS. 

Note that one individual can receive multiple self-test kits (e.g., one for themselves and one for their partner or partners). **Data for the numerator should be generated by counting the number of individual HIV self-test kits distributed and NOT the number of individuals receiving an HIV self-test kit.** Number of self-test kits distributed should be captured and reported at the lowest distribution point. The lowest distribution point refers to the individual/site giving out self-test kits and capturing data for monitoring purposes. This is to prevent double counting between the various higher supply chain levels. 

**For example,** the central warehouse distributes 500 self-test kits to an implementing partner doing outreach for KPs. The implementing partner gives their peer outreach workers a total of 50 self-test kits to give out during an outreach event. The outreach workers return from their event having given out 30 self-test kits. In this scenario, the lowest distribution point would be the outreach workers who are capturing the monitoring data. Therefore, the number of tests kits distributed would be 30. Each of these lowest distribution counts should be rolled up (aggregated) to create the numerator for this indicator. 

The disaggregation by type of self-testing provides information about the proportion of test kits distributed through each model (i.e., directly assisted vs. unassisted self- testing). Further disaggregation by “number of tests distributed to a person by age/sex” (for both directly assisted and unassisted self-testing) and “test kit distributed for use by” (for unassisted self-testing) can provide information about what subpopulations are receiving HIVST kits and who the test kit is intended for use by (i.e., self, sex partner, other) in the unassisted model. The findings can support national government and PEPFAR programs to assess how efficient different distribution approaches are at reaching target populations. These data may also be useful for projecting programmatic commodities (e.g., self-test kits) and systems needs (e.g., staffing resources). It is important to note that for the purposes of this indicator, it is assumed that the tests distributed to individuals and counted in the directly assisted self-testing model are the used by individuals that received them so the disaggregation for “test kit distributed for use by” is not requested in the directly assisted model. Please refer to the example clarification below for additional details. 

**For example,** if an 18-year-old female reports to a testing site and receives a one-on-one testing demonstration for herself – the test for herself will be reported as directly assisted and you would provide the age/sex disaggregation data for one test kit distributed in the 15-19-year-old age band. When she leaves the clinic, she takes two additional test kits along with her: one for her sex partner and one for her friend to use at a later time. The two test kits for her sex partner and friend would be counted as unassisted. For the age/sex breakdown under unassisted, 2 tests would go in the 15-19- year-old female age band because two tests were distributed to the female in that age band. **The reporting follows the distribution of the test kits and not the age/sex demographics of the end user of the self-test kit.** For the “test kit distributed for use by” disaggregate, you would indicate a ‘1’ in the ‘sex partner’ disaggregate for the test she planned to distribute to her sex partner and a ‘1’ in the ‘other’ disaggregate for the test she planned to distribute to her friend. 

It is understood that registers and procedures for HIVST are still relatively new in many PEPFAR countries and specific distribution methods (e.g., vending machines) may not always allow for collection of detailed data on self-test kit distribution. As such, the only required disaggregate for this indicator will be for the type of self-testing (i.e., directly- assisted vs. unassisted). In addition, age/sex demographic information for test kits distributed using the directly-assisted self-testing model will also be required as these individuals should have received an in-person HIV test kit demonstration and demographic information should be collected at that time 

Note: Although not required, implementing partners should attempt to document and report information about actual use of self-test kits. This includes who used the test kit, the test result from the self-test and linkage to retesting (if result is reactive), particularly when directly assisted HIVST occurs. Methods used may include request the return of the kits or follow up calls to determine outcomes. This information can further inform whether HIVST services are reaching individuals who may be HIV-positive and if those individuals are retesting to confirm their diagnosis. 

For more information on HIV self-testing, please refer to the “**WHO Guidelines on HIV Self-Testing and Partner Notification**” released in December 2016. To review a repository of country-specific guidance and polices related to HIV self-testing, please visit the **HIV Self-Testing Research and Policy Hub**.","Data should be reviewed regularly for the purposes of program management, to monitor progress towards achieving targets, and to identify and correct any data quality issues. For example, the number of test kits distributed should not be greater than the number of test kits a provider allocated during the reporting period.

The disaggregation by test result provides information about the proportion of persons testing HIV positive and the effectiveness of HTS programs in identifying people living with HIV (PLHIV) over time. 

Further disaggregations are intended to monitor access to and uptake of HTS by population (age, sex, and test result), HTS setting and service delivery modality. The findings can support national governments and PEPFAR programs to determine the coverage and identify gaps in HTS services. These data may also be useful for projecting programmatic commodities and system needs such as HIV test kits and other staffing resources, _although the numerator reflects the number of individuals tested, not the number of tests performed._","Existing HTS registers, log books, and reporting forms already in use to capture HTS can be revised to include the updated disaggregation categories. Examples of data collection forms include client intake forms, activity report forms, or health registers such as HTS registers, health information systems and non-governmental organization records. Data for the numerator should be generated by counting the total number of individuals who received HTS and their test results. 

**Note: Although several other MER indicators (see below) may report on the HIV status of individuals, actual testing of individuals must be reported under HTS_TST. Thus, any persons who are newly tested as part of the programs linked to the indicators listed below (i.e., PMTCT, TB, VMMC, Prevention services) must be reported as part of the HTS_TST indicator.** 
* **PMTCT_STAT** 
* **TB_STAT** 
* **VMMC_CIRC** 
* **PP_PREV** 
* **KP_PREV** 
* **OVC_HIVSTAT** 

For an individual to be counted under this indicator, that individual’s HIV diagnosis must be confirmed using a nationally validated testing algorithm. For example, an HIV-positive rapid HIV test performed at the community- or facility- level must be confirmed with a second test, which may be performed at the same site or at a different facility. If the confirmatory test is performed at a different facility, then this may entail follow-up by implementing partners to confirm the diagnosis before reporting on this indicator. 

Note: _**Serologic testing of pediatric patients should be counted under HTS_TST. However, HIV virologic testing of HIV-exposed infants should be counted under PMTCT_EID and PMTCT_HEI_POS.**_ 

For children <1, only if serologic tests are used for diagnostic purposes should they be reported under HTS_TST. Serologic tests for screening infants should be excluded (including tests to look for HIV exposure at age 9 months or another time point). Since diagnosis of HIV infection in infants is based on virologic and not serologic tests, the general expectation is not to see results in the “< 1” disaggregate of the HTS_TST indicator. However, if the partner/program uses serologic-based testing to confirm absence of HIV infection in infants <1-year-old who have not breastfed for at least 3 months prior to testing, you may use the HTS_TST <1 indicator to report negative diagnostic results for such cases. 

Note: _**Retesting for verification of HIV positive status before or at antiretroviral (ART) initiation should not be counted under HTS_TST,**_ since testing of this individual will have already been counted at the point of the initial diagnosis. Retesting for verification is primarily done as a quality assurance activity to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure those initiated on ART are indeed HIV positive. Therefore, retesting for verification should only be performed for persons who have received an HIV diagnosis but have not yet been initiated on ART. 

**While verification testing should not be recorded as HTS_TST or HTS_TST_POS, these data should nevertheless be tracked and rates of discordancy monitored.** 

**Key Populations:** 

Provision of information (tested, tested positive, tested negative) on key Populations (FSW, MSM, Transgender people, PWID, and people in prisons and other closed settings) who were tested and received their results should be reported here. Importantly, reporting on this disaggregate is optional. 

Key population disaggregation* see Appendix 1 to support the identification of key populations at HTS service delivery. However, reporting of key population disaggregation should be consistent with what is described under the KP_PREV “How to review for data quality” section on mutual exclusivity of an individual who falls under multiple KP categories (e.g., FSW who injects drugs). In such instances, the individual should only be reported in ONE KP disaggregation category with which s/he is most identifies in order to avoid double-counting. 

Note: Both KP-specific and clinical partners have the option to complete these disaggs, but only if it is safe to maintain these files and report. Age and sex data on KPs tested and receiving their results will not be reported—these disaggregates are separate and distinct from disaggregates for male/female. Please refer to the KP_PREV and PP_PREV indicator reference sheets for more information on working with KPs. 

The first priority of data collection and reporting of HTS among key populations must be to do no harm. These data must be managed confidentially to ensure the identities of individuals are protected and to prevent further stigma and discrimination of key populations. 

Please also note the misalignment of reporting frequency between HTS_TST [quarterly] and KP_PREV [semi-annually] and the differences in the process of de-duplication of individuals (HTS_TST is de-duplicated within the quarter, whereas KP_PREV is de- duplicated within the fiscal year). For example, if a KP is reached and tested more than once within the fiscal year, s/he will only be counted once under KP_PREV, but could be counted multiple times under HTS_TST KP disaggregation during same the fiscal year if the KP was tested multiple times in different quarters. However, if a KP is tested multiple times within the **same quarter**, s/he should be deduplicated (i.e., only be counted once in the quarter). Please be cognizant of such limitations when interpreting KP_PREV, HTS_TST, and HTS_TST_POS cascade data by key populations. 

**Data Systems and Tools** 

When developing or modifying existing M&E systems and tools to collect and report on this indicator, the following information should be considered (* designates data elements that are required for HTS_TST reporting in DATIM): 
1. This indicator counts the number of individuals tested not the number of tests conducted. All efforts should be made to ensure data are collected on individuals tested vs. number of tests conducted through de-duplication. Within HTS registers, collecting data on the following variables should be considered to help in these efforts: 
    1. Retesting status: new tester, re-tester (i.e., tested in the last 3 months), retesting to verify an HIV-positive diagnosis before ART initiation 
    1. HIV testing services - *HIV test results, date of HIV test, receipt of HIV test results, previously tested during the reporting period 
    1. Demographic - Client’s Unique ID, name, *sex, and *age at time of HTS services 
    1. Date HIV-positive individual was linked to treatment 
    1. Site - *site name and ID, district, region, province, and *service delivery modality 
2. Using unique identifiers for individuals is one way to account for retesting and avoid double reporting if electronic systems are available to easily link data through these unique identifiers. Another approach is to record information about prior testing on the HTS client register. 
3. For an individual to be counted under this indicator, their HIV diagnosis must be confirmed using a nationally validated testing algorithm. For example, an HIV- positive rapid HIV test performed at the community- or facility- level must be confirmed with a second test, which may be performed at the same site or at a different facility. If the confirmatory test is performed at a different facility, then this may entail follow-up by implementing partners to confirm the diagnosis before reporting on this indicator. 
4. Note: Retesting for verification of HIV positive status before or at antiretroviral (ART) treatment initiation is only done for persons who have already been diagnosed HIV-positive as per the national HIV testing guidelines. All clients diagnosed HIV-positive should be retested for verification before or at ART initiation with a new specimen and preferably a second operator using the same national HIV testing strategy. Retesting for verification is primarily done as a quality assurance activity to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure those initiated on ART and treatment services are indeed HIV positive. Thus, HIV testing conducted to verify status should not be counted under HTS_TST, since their initial HIV diagnosis will have already been counted at the point of the initial receipt of the HIV diagnosis (as per the national HIV testing guidelines). 
5. Patient level Deduplication: adding “has patient been tested in the last 3 months” to the HTS facility and community registers can help partners de-duplicate at the reporting level.","Only one age disaggregation type is used for age/sex/test result received: The number of individuals newly receiving ART must be disaggregated by age and sex. If possible, the full age/sex disaggregations should be used. If the full age/sex disaggregations are not possible, then, and only then, should the aggregated age/sex disaggregations be used. Do NOT complete both age/sex disaggregations. 

Numerator ≥ subtotal of each disaggregate group: The total number of individuals receiving HTS (numerator) should be equal to the sum of each individual disaggregation group (age/sex/test result/service delivery modality). If the sum of each individual disaggregation group (age/sex/test result/service delivery modality) is greater than the total number of individuals receiving HTS (numerator), then there were more individuals entered for the disaggregations than for the overall number of individuals receiving HTS. This should be corrected. If the sum of each individual disaggregation group (age/sex/test result/service delivery modality) is less than the total number of individuals receiving HTS, then some data are missing for the disaggregations. This should also be corrected.",Sum results across quarters.,"**Numerator:** Number of individuals who received HIV Testing Services (HTS) and received their test results

In addition to reporting the total number of individuals tested and receiving their test results and the total type of test results received (negative, positive), HTS_TST data should be disaggregated by service delivery modality, and then also by age/sex/test result within each service delivery modality. Service delivery modalities can reflect a reason for testing (index partner, STI), as well as, the location/place of testing (e.g., inpatient ward, VCT drop-in center). Therefore, please use a hierarchical approach to determine the appropriate modality, by prioritizing the reason for testing followed by the location/place of testing. 

Service delivery modalities are defined as: 

_**Community-based testing:**_ Applies to any testing done outside of a designated health facility. Within community-based testing, the following disaggregates are available: 
1. **Index:** Index testing, also referred to as partner testing/partner notification services, is an approach whereby the exposed contacts (i.e., spouse, sexual partners, biological children and needle-sharing partners) of an HIV-positive person, known as the index case, are elicited and offered HIV testing services. The Index modality is used to define testing of contacts who have been exposed to HIV through an index case. These contacts include: sexual partners, needle- sharing partners, and biological children of female index cases. Testing of persons who have not had exposure through an index case, such as neighbors or family members not born to the index, should not be reported under the Index modality. Instead, these individuals should be counted under “other community platforms”. While testing the contacts of an index case may occur in mobile, VCT or other community testing venue, this testing should be reported under the index modality, which takes precedence over the other service delivery modalities. That is, if an individual could be reported under both index testing and another modality, that individual should only be reported once under index testing. 
2. **Mobile:** Testing in Mobile ad hoc or temporary testing locations, such as community centers, schools, workplaces, and includes testing in mobile unit such as tents and vans. Testing related to VMMC services is not included here. Instead that should be reported under facility based VMMC modality. 
3. **VCT:** Includes testing conducted in standalone VCT center that exists outside of a designated health facility (e.g., drop-in-center, wellness clinic where HTS services are provided, testing sites aimed at key populations, etc.). 
4. **Other community platforms:** Includes all community-based modalities not captured above (e.g., ad hoc testing campaign that does not satisfy the mobile testing definition) and community-based OVC testing) should be entered under this modality. 

_**Facility-based testing:**_ Applies to any testing occurring inside a designated health facility. Within the facility-based testing, the following disaggregates are available: 
1. **Index:** Index testing, also referred to as partner testing/partner notification services, is an approach whereby exposed contacts (i.e., spouse, sexual partners, biological children, and needle-sharing partners) of an HIV-positive person, known as the index case, are elicited and offered HIV testing services. The Index modality is used to define testing of contacts who have been exposed to HIV through an index case. These contacts include: sexual partners, needle-sharing partners, and biological children of female index cases. Testing of persons who have not had exposure through an index case (i.e., non-exposed contacts), such as neighbors or family members not born to an index case, should not be reported under the Index modality. If these non-exposed contacts come to a facility for an HIV test, their results should be reported under the “VCT” modality. Index testing in a facility-based setting (testing the exposed contacts of an index case) can occur in a variety of service delivery points within a facility (e.g., TB, VCT, inpatient, etc.). However, all index-based testing should be reported using the Index modality, which takes precedence over all the other service delivery modalities That is, if an individual could be reported under both index testing and another modality, that individual should only be reported once under index testing 
1. **Provider Initiated Counseling and Testing (PITC):** 
   1. **Malnutrition:** Clinics and inpatient wards predominately dedicated to the treatment of malnourished children. While this service delivery modality may be part of either inpatient or outpatient services, if an individual could be reported under both malnutrition and another service delivery modality, report an individual only once and under malnutrition. However, the biological children of female index cases should be classified under the Index testing modality. 
   2. **Pediatrics:** Includes Provider Initiated Counseling and Testing offered to children under 14 years of age at any service delivery modality within the health facility (e.g., under 5/EPI clinic (immunization or well child services), pediatric inpatient wards, etc.). This does not include virologic testing, which is reported under PMTCT_EID, nor rapid HIV testing used to identify HIV exposed infants. This modality should also not include children of index cases who should be classified under the Index modality or malnourished children who should be classified under Malnutrition. 
   3. **Inpatient:** Includes Provider Initiated Testing & Counseling (PITC) occurring among those patients admitted in the inpatient and surgery wards. 
   4. **Emergency:** Includes persons tested or seen in a designated emergency department or ward for the immediate care and treatment of an unforeseen illness or injury. 
   5. **TB:** Includes persons referred for HIV testing because they are a confirmed or a presumptive TB case. HIV testing may have taken place in a TB clinic, a co-located VCT or other setting. However, if the reason for the HIV test is that the client is a TB case or a TB suspect, then it should be classified under the TB modality. Refer to TB_STAT for guidelines on data collection for TB. 
   6. **STI:** Includes persons seen in a designated STI clinic as well as patients seen in the OPD for STI symptoms. This includes suspect and confirmed STI cases. HIV testing may take place in an STI clinic, an OPD, a co-located VCT or other setting. However, if the reason for the HIV testing is the individual is either a suspect or confirmed STI case, then the test should be reported under the STI modality. 
   7. **PMTCT (ANC Only):** Pregnant women newly tested at antenatal care clinic (ANC) ANC setting (_**who would also be reported under PMTCT_STAT**_) should be reported under HTS_TST in the facility-based modality of PMTCT (ANC only). HIV testing for pregnant women as part of the PMTCT program at antenatal care clinics (ANC) to align with PMTCT_STAT. Refer to PMTCT_STAT reference sheet for guidelines on data collection. Individuals counted under PMTCT_STAT who already knew their status should not be reported under HTS_TST. If a woman is newly tested at a different service delivery point other than ANC (e.g., labor and delivery, family planning clinics, etc.), results should be reported under the appropriate facility- based HTS modality (inpatient, PITC-other, etc.) and not under the PMTCT (ANC Only) disaggregate and not under PMTCT_STAT. Please note in the HTS narrative which modality you are using to report new tests at L&D and any postnatal care (e.g., in-patient, PITC-other). 
   1. **Other PITC:** This includes any other provider-initiated testing and counseling that is not captured in one of the other testing modalities listed above. For reporting purposes, this includes testing of patients triaged to other clinics within the OPD that see patients for routine/chronic care (i.e., eye, dental, dermatology, diabetes, etc.). This does not include patients seen in the OPD for emergency care or an STI. Those patients should be classified under the emergency and STI modalities, respectively. 
1. **VMMC:** This modality includes HIV testing for males conducted as part of VMMC programs in both facility and mobile outreach programs. Testing is recommended through the VMMC program, although not mandatory. Refer to VMMC_CIRC for guidelines on data collection for VMMC. 
1. **VCT:** Refers to a clinic specifically intended for HIV testing services that is co- located within a broader health care facility. Use this modality for VCT walk-ins, client-initiated HIV testing, and clients who have been previously mobilized to get an HIV test. This should not include testing of patients referred by providers from other clinical services within the facility (TB, ANC, Inpatient, emergency, etc.). Even though the actual test may be administered in the VCT clinic, report those individuals under the serviced delivery modality from which they were referred. This modality should also not include testing of exposed partners and exposed family members of an index case, who should be reported under the Index disaggregate.",,,"Standard definition of DSD and TA-SDI used.

*Partner should also report the number of individuals tested under the indicator “HTS_TST” if HTS was conducted (and results were given) as part of the outreach activity. If it was a documented complete HTS referral to the facility, it can be counted as HTS_TST_TA. Please refer to the HTS_TST indicator definition sheet for details.","Tracking systems must be able to reduce double-counting of individuals in a reporting period. The numerator can be generated by counting the number of de-duplicated individuals who were reached and had completed the appropriate prevention intervention(s) designed for the intended key population. For example, this means that when a unique individual receives HTS referral plus condoms and lubricant at more than one occasion during the reporting period, _**the person is counted only once**_ for being reached for this indicator. 

Furthermore, _**de-duplication of all returning beneficiaries within the Q3-Q4 reporting period (April 1 – September 30) will also need to take place in Q4 reporting if they had already been counted under KP_PREV in Q1-Q2 of the same fiscal year.**_ For example, if an individual had received prevention interventions under KP_PREV through PEPFAR- supported program in January 2017 and was counted as being reached in FY17 Q2 reporting cycle, and this same individual was later reached with prevention services again by PEPFAR-supported program in June 2017, that individual should NOT be reported again in the FY17 Q4 reporting period. This de-duplication is critical to accurately track the _**ANNUAL**_ number of unique individuals reached by PEPFAR within a given fiscal year. Trend analysis of past performance of KP_PREV data will be adversely affected with the change in frequency of KP_PREV reporting from annually to semi- annually if this de-duplication is ignored (i.e., annual number of KP_PREV reported within the same fiscal year would be inflated as the same individual would be counted twice if this de-duplication does not occur at Q4 reporting). 

If possible, a unique identifier can be assigned. The use of a unique identifier can help programs monitor the frequency of contact/outreach of a single individual over time (i.e., Beneficiary A with unique identifier AW0901 had four documented outreach visits in FY17 but was only counted once under KP_PREV in FY17).","Data should be reviewed regularly for the purposes of program management, to monitor progress towards achieving targets, and to identify and correct any data quality issues.

Given the elevated risk of HIV infection among children affected by and vulnerable to HIV, it is imperative for PEPFAR implementing partners to monitor HIV status among OVC beneficiaries, and to facilitate access and retention in ART treatment for those who are HIV positive. When the implementing partner knows the HIV status, the program can contribute to ensuring that the children are linked to appropriate care and treatment services, all essential elements of quality case management. OVC programs can also play an important role in family-centered disclosure, for those who are HIV positive. 
* This indicator is NOT intended to be an indicator of HIV tests performed or receipt of testing results, as these are measured elsewhere and test results are frequently unavailable to community organizations due to health facility concerns about patient confidentiality. 
* This indicator is NOT intended to imply that all OVC beneficiaries require an HIV test. OVC with known positive or negative status do not need to be tested. Only OVC with no HIV status or children reported to be negative and recently experiencing sexual violence and/or other risk factors in the reporting period should be assessed for HIV risk. For older children who the IP thinks may be sexually active, they should be assessed every reporting period. 
* Status disclosure to the implementing partner is NOT a prerequisite for enrollment or continuation in an OVC program. OVC programs serve persons of positive, negative, and unknown HIV status appropriate to their needs and vulnerability to HIV. This indicator ensures that IPs are regularly providing outreach to caregivers to identify children’s HIV status, encourage family disclosure and linkage to care and treatment as needed. 
* This indicator captures if implementing partners are tracking the self-reported HIV status of the orphans and vulnerable children they serve and enrollment in ART for those who are positive. Testing results for OVC who are referred for testing should be reported under HTS_TST based on the service delivery point where they were tested 
* This indicator also captures if implementing partners are tracking if the orphans and vulnerable children they serve who report to be HIV positive are successfully linked to and retained in treatment and care. 
* This indicator is a subset from OVC_SERV. Only OVC who were reported under OVC_SERV <18 should be included in the denominator for this indicator. 
* Since this is not a testing indicator, HIV positivity yield should NOT be calculated based on this indicator. Yield calculations should only be made by testing partners.","Data sources for this indicator include HIV test results that are self-reported by OVC (or their caregivers), results of HIV Risk Assessments conducted by implementing partners, registers, referral forms, client records, or other confidential case management and program monitoring tools that track those in treatment and care. 

Implementation of the HIV risk assessment should be integrated into case management and on-going case monitoring and should not be conducted separately, if possible. This will vary by partner and project. The partners should work out a timeline based on their experience of how long referral completion and status disclosure usually takes and factor that into their case management processes.

OVC entered as “Reported HIV positive to IP” in the previous reporting period, should continue to be reported as positive during the current reporting period and their enrollment in ART noted. 
* **“Reported HIV negative to IP”** includes beneficiaries <age 18 who report that they are HIV negative to the IP based on an HIV test conducted during the reporting period (regardless of where the test occurred). For a child who reports multiple tests within the current period, use most recent test. For beneficiaries entered as “Reported HIV negative to IP” in a previous reporting period—if the IP believes the child’s risk has not changed in the last six months, they should continue to report the child as negative during the current reporting period. However, if the IP believes that the child has recently been exposed to risk of HIV infection (e.g., sexual violence) or if an adolescent has become sexually active, then the IP should conduct the HIV risk assessment. Potential outcomes reported after the HIV risk assessment include 1) the child is tested and reported as HIV positive and either currently receiving ART or not receiving ART, or 2) the child is tested and reported as HIV negative, or 3) the child is reported as “No Status” and under one of its disaggregates (“Test not indicated” or “Other reasons”).

Mitigating the impact that HIV is having on children and the families that support them is integral to a comprehensive HIV response. It is important to note that the definition of “affected” children includes, but is not limited to, children infected with HIV. PEPFAR recognizes that individuals, families, and communities are affected by HIV in ways that may hinder the medical outcomes of HIV-positive persons as well as the emotional and physical development of children orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS. A variety of services (per Technical Considerations 2017) are supported through PEPFAR to mitigate these effects in order to improve health and well-being outcomes of adults and children. The goal of OVC programs is to build stability and resiliency in children and families- exposed, living with or affected by HIV/AIDS through rigorous case management and provision and access to health and socio-economic interventions. This indicator, by disaggregating “active”, “graduated”, “transferred”, and “exited without graduation” measures how successful the OVC program is in building children and their families’ resiliency.","The data sources are the PEPFAR OVC program registers and program data generated by implementing partners. Implementing partners’ registers need to record names of children and caregivers who meet the criteria for “active beneficiary” or “graduated” or “transferred” or “exited without graduation” to generate the number included in this indicator.

All agencies receiving HKID funding are required to report on this indicator.

This indicator is a direct (output) measure of the number of individuals receiving PEPFAR OVC program services for children and families affected by HIV/AIDS and tracks progress on the number of OVC graduating from PEPFAR OVC programs and tracks “exited without graduation” (such as loss-to-follow up, aging out without transition plan, moved, or died).

There is a risk of double counting as a pregnant woman receiving ART at ANC should have multiple visits for each pregnancy therefore partners should ensure a data collection and reporting system is in place to minimize double counting of the same pregnant women across visits including a paper based longitudinal ANC or PMTCT register (meaning a register that is able to record all information about 1 pregnancy in one location, with rows or columns that allow for recording information on multiple visits during that pregnancy) or an electronic medical record/patient tracking system. There is also a risk of undercounting if those women who already on ART prior to attending ANC are not documented, therefore the ANC register should document both “New on ART” and “Already on ART at the beginning of the current pregnancy”. Women who initiate ART while breastfeeding should not be counted under this indicator, and should instead be reported as part of the TX_NEW indicator (see TX_NEW; disaggregate group pregnancy/breastfeeding status).

Therefore, coverage at site level must be understood within the context of the service delivery model at that site. For example, in local areas where ART is integrated into ANC and low volume PMTCT sites are only testing for HIV and then referring women to other facilities for ART, the expectation is that for one individual PMTCT_STAT_POS (newly tested) will be documented at one facility and PMTCT_ART (new on ART) would be documented at another facility leading to the appearance of greater than >100% coverage at one site and 0% coverage at another.

The numerator can be generated by counting the number of HIV- positive pregnant women who received antiretrovirals to reduce MTCT in the reporting period, by regimen.

For the denominator: Two methods can be used to estimate the denominator: an estimation model, such as Spectrum, using the output, number of pregnant women needing PMTCT; or, if Spectrum estimates are not available, by multiplying the number of women giving birth in the past 12 months (which can be obtained from estimates of the central statistics office, United Nations Population Division or pregnancy registration systems with complete data) by the most recent national estimate of HIV prevalence in pregnant women (which can be derived from HIV sentinel surveillance in ANC and appropriate adjustments related to coverage of ANC surveys).",,,,,,This data should be entered in DATIM by the USG country team.,"Host country teams often set targets by OU, and SNU level to plan their programs (please describe the target setting process that the host country employs in the narratives).

This percentage is a proxy measure, since the infants in the numerator could include infants whose mothers were not included in the PMTCT_STAT denominator. 

The numerator is a measure of sample collection for virologic testing. Throughout the reference guide the term “received a first virologic test” specifically means “had a first sample collected for virologic testing.” Age refers to age at specimen collection",Number of infants who had a first virologic HIV test (sample collected) by 12 months of age during the reporting period,"Calculated indicator in DATIM, sum of: Infants who had a first virologic HIV test (sample collected) between birth and 2 months of age; Infants who had a first virologic HIV test (sample collected) between 2 and 12 months of age","**PMTCT_STAT_POS (see PMTCT_STAT);** Denominator is no longer collected as part of indicator, but rather is calculated as PMTCT_STAT_POS.","Calculated indicator in DATIM, sum of: 1) Newly Tested Positive, 2) Known Positive at entry (see PMTCT_STAT, Disaggregate Group Positivity Status for more details)","* Clarification that reported test is based on infant’s age when the sample was collected for virologic testing, not based on when sample was sent or result returned (MER 1.0 to MER 2.0).

* Infants’ diagnoses through virologic test results (positive, negative, unknown) are no longer reported within this indicator. Refer to new PMTCT_HEI_POS indicator for guidance on how to report on infants diagnosed HIV positive as well as confirmation of their ART initiation (MER 2.0 v2.1 to v2.2).",Facility,Quarterly,"This indicator measures the extent to which HIV-exposed infants receive a first virologic HIV test to determine their HIV status by 12 months of age. The indicator is disaggregated by the age of the infant at the time of sample collection, specifically between birth and 2 months and between 2 and 12 months of age. 

Only infants whose samples were collected for the first test for each HIV-exposed infant should be counted in this indicator, including dried blood spots (DBS) and samples collected for POC testing (e.g., Alere, Xpert). Even though there is ongoing exposure of infants to HIV (through breastfeeding), this indicator only measures access to a first test, and not access to all the recommended HIV tests throughout breastfeeding. HIV status of infants at the end of the breastfeeding period and the outcomes of the PMTCT program would be measured in PMTCT_FO. 

The positive results of HIV infant virologic testing are collected in a new, separate indicator in effect for FY18, called PMTCT_HEI_POS. Please see the reference sheet for PMTCT_HEI_POS for more information, as the definitions for the new indicator are distinct from PMTCT_EID.","Implementing partners should report on all infants whose samples were collected for a first virologic test, **even if no test result has been recorded** in the patient record/register at the time of reporting. 

This indicator should be collected from the clinical source (i.e., HIV-exposed infant registers or patient records) to ensure unduplicated patient counting. HIV-exposed infant registers should be used to count exposed infants and samples collected for virologic testing. (If available, information could come from electronic systems). If the standard report does not contain all the required information, individual patient files should be used. Additional supporting information for this indicator can be obtained from standard laboratory information systems (i.e., DNA PCR or POC/near POC log books or electronic systems) however, it will be important to ensure that repeat tests of the same sample or HIV-infected infants receiving a confirmatory virologic HIV test result are not counted twice. 

Only samples collected for a first virologic HIV test should be included in this indicator. A virologic test is a test used for HIV diagnosis in infants up to 18 months of age. The most commonly used form of virologic testing or nucleic acid testing (“NAT”) is HIV DNA PCR on dried blood spots (DBS) but this indicator also includes samples collected for POC testing. Three other types of testing should not be reported: 1) Serologic testing of childrenshouldnotbereportedinthisindicator.(SeeHTS_TSTforadditionaldetails). 2) Virologic tests conducted with the purpose of confirming the diagnosis of HIV, 3) Virologic tests used for clinical monitoring of children on ART, such as viral load quantification **Additionally, only the first sample collected should be counted for each infant, even if they have had more than one virologic test done.** 

The numerator is divided into first sample collected between birth and 2 months of age and first sample collected between 2 and 12 months of age. The 0-2 month and 2-12- month age periods are based on age at collection of sample, not on date of result return to the facility or caregiver. It is likely that at the time of reporting there will be samples that have been collected but for which no result is documented in the register or patient record.","Infant testing coverage (PMTCT_EID / PMTCT_STAT_POS) is a proxy calculation, relying on PMTCT_STAT_POS as a proxy denominator for the total number of HIV exposed infants (HEI). Reviewing infants with a first virologic test (N) against PMTCT_STAT_POS results (D) should be done carefully—see assumptions and limitations below. Review of outlier percentages for testing coverage by age band is recommended (e.g., review high and low outliers for 0-≤2-month testing coverage disaggregate).

Assumption: the total number of HIV positive pregnant women, and therefore HEI, does not significantly vary quarter by quarter. We would not expect all the women reported under PMTCT_STAT_POS to have given birth to the infants reported under PMTCT_EID. However, despite that time period mismatch, the assumption is that the total number of HIV positive women (estimated HEI) does not vary significantly quarter by quarter, so it is reasonable to compare infants tested to the STAT_POS denominator from the same reporting time period. 

Example Limitations 
* PMTCT_STAT_POS could underestimate the number of HEI because it includes only women who are HIV-positive at ANC1 for the current pregnancy. It does not include women who attend ANC1 and are HIV+ but are not diagnosed; or any woman who seroconverts after ANC1, during delivery, or breastfeeding. 
* PMTCT_STAT_POS could overestimate the number of HEI that should be tested, because not all pregnancies may come to term. 

See the new PMTCT_HEI_POS indicator reference sheet for a description of considerations and limitations in calculating proxy positivity for HEI (PMTCT_HEI_POS / PMTCT_EID).",Sum results across quarters.,"**Numerator:**

(Note: Collection of 18 month visit outcomes is recommended at 24 months of age, see additional explanation to the right.)","Calculated indicator in DATIM, sum of: HIV- infected, HIV-uninfected, HIV-final status unknown, died without status known. 

It is recommended to wait to collect the 18 month visit outcomes until the patient is 24 months old for the following reasons: 1) this allows for children who present several months late to their 18 month visit to be included in the numerator and 2) cohort reporting is easiest when monthly reporting by facilities is used and where the birth month and the reporting month are the same calendar month (i.e., for infants born in January 2012, their 24 month reporting month would be January 2014, rather than using the 18 month reporting month of July 2013).",Number of HIV-exposed infants who were born 24 months prior to the reporting period and registered in the birth cohort.,Only those HIV-exposed infants registered in the birth cohort at any time between 0 and 18 months of age (including transfers-ins) who were born 24 months prior to the reporting period are included in the denominator.,N/A,Facility,Annually,"In settings where national guidelines support breastfeeding of HIV-exposed infants, antibody testing of all HIV-exposed children at 18 months of age and/or 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding is recommended to determine final HIV status (‘final outcome’/FO) of HIV-exposed children. To accomplish this goal, it is recommended to identify infants at birth or at the first infant follow-up visit and track them through the end of the breastfeeding period. This indicator measures progress toward ensuring that all infants born to HIV-positive women have an outcome documented. In settings where a mother-infant register is utilized and/or it is common practice for HIV-infected women to breastfeed less than or more than 18 months please describe in the narrative the final outcome time point.","To report on this indicator PEPFAR supported sites would ideally use registers or facility held cards for HIV exposed infants that collect longitudinal information on follow-up and are organized by birth month of infants. This methodology is referred to as birth cohort reporting. 

Two examples of birth cohort reporting: 
1. In Kenya, this indicator was first piloted by PEPFAR and the Ministry of Health in Western Kenya and is currently integrated into the national HIV summary reporting tool. Data from the facility HIV exposed infant longitudinal follow-up register, which organizes infants by birth-month cohorts, are aggregated into a report summarizing outcomes for infants reaching 24 months of age during each month. 
2. In Malawi, clinic staff complete monthly follow up reporting forms as part of the national quarterly supervision visits using data collected directly from HIV- exposed infant cards which are kept in a binder that is organized by birth month (no HIV exposed register is used). 

As an example, for those infants born in FY 2015, the outcomes would be reported in FY 2017.

Both approaches allow a paper-based health facility records to quickly identify the number of HIV-exposed infants registered in the birth cohort at any time between 0 and 18 months of age (denominator).","By design this indicator should equal 100% if all outcomes are known regardless of outcome type. This allows for facilities to check that all HIV-exposed infants have an outcome assigned to them during the reporting process. Data utilization requires reviewing the disaggregated data to understand the specific outcomes of interest. In settings where HIV-exposed infant registers do not allow for documentation of all disaggregated outcomes, country teams should report only on available disaggregates even if the aggregate indicator is less than 100%, however this should be specified in the narrative. 

The denominator should include those “Transferred In” and those “Transferred Out” as long as for “Transferred In” there is documentation that HIV-exposed infants were registered at their original site in the birth cohort at any time between 0 and 18 months of age and were born 24 months prior to the reporting period. “Transferred Out” should be reported under HIV status unknown. The inclusion of Transfers-In/Out provides a quality check to ensure that all exposed infants have an outcome assigned to them during the reporting process such that the sum of the numerator disaggregation equals the denominator. However, this may lead to outcomes for >100% of HIV positive pregnant women (PMTCT_STAT_POS) identified at a site so this comparison should not be used as a logic check.",Use annual result reported at Q4.,"**Numerator:** Number of HIV- exposed infants with a documented outcome by 18 months of age disaggregated by outcome type.

For the numerator to be calculated, implementing partners are required to report: 
* **HIV-infected:** Number of HIV-exposed infants identified as HIV-infected at any point during follow-up. HIV-infected includes infants and children with diagnostic virologic or serologic confirmation of HIV-infection (DNA PCR before 18 months; rapid test at 18 months) and those with a presumptive HIV diagnosis where DNA PCR is not available. Site should also maintain data on HIV infected infants and whether they are linked or not linked to ART services, or whether they have no information on patient linkage to ART programs. 
* **HIV-uninfected:** Number of HIV-exposed infants with a negative 18-month antibody test documented. Based on national guidelines, countries should determine if “HIV- uninfected” includes infants with a documented negative antibody test that was done at least 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding but before 18 months of age.

* Infants’ first virologic test results (positive, negative, and unknown) are no longer being reported under PMTCT_EID. The total number of positive infants identified through virologic testing will be collected through the new PMTCT_HEI_POS indicator, however, the definition for positive infants in the new indicator is different from the definition for the PMTCT_EID positive infant disaggregate in MER 2.0 (MER 2.0 v2.1 to v2.2).",Facility,Quarterly,"This indicator measures how many HIV-infected infants are identified in a reporting period, disaggregated by age at sample collection and ART initiation status. Identification is by virologic HIV testing: DNA PCR testing of dried blood spots (DBS) or point of care (POC) (e.g., Alere, Xpert) virologic testing. Infants are defined as a child aged between 0 days (newborn) and 12 months of age, and age disaggregation is based on the infant age at the time of sample collection. The infant age reported should not be based on how old the infant was when the result was available to the site. 

This indicator can include infants identified as HIV-infected on any virologic test by 12 months of age and is not limited to infants identified as HIV-infected on their first virologic test. Infants may be HIV-uninfected on their first virologic test, but at a later age be identified as HIV-infected, and they should be counted in this indicator as long as they were aged 0 - 12 months at the time of subsequent sample collection. Confirmatory testing (collection of a second sample for repeat virologic testing after the first virologic test is positive) is excluded. 

Positive Infants and Linkage to ART: PMTCT_HEI_POS will be used to track how many positive infants are identified in a reporting period, and the “ART initiation confirmed” disaggregate can be compared to PMTCT_HEI_POS positive infants to describe rates of linkage to ART for HIV-infected infants (PMTCT_HEI_POS_ART / PMTCT_HEI_POS). The age disaggregate will also help describe linkage rates for very young infants (0-2mo). The proportion of positive infants confirmed as initiating ART can be used to help identify sites with potential successes or challenges in documentation, linkage, and/or initiation of infected infants. 

Comparison to TX_NEW age <1: the disaggregate for PMTCT_HEI_POS infants confirmed as initiating ART (sum of 0-2 and 2-12 months) could be compared to “infants <1-year- old initiated on ART (TX_NEW <1)."" However, equal values for PMTCT_HEI_POS_ART and TX_NEW age <1 may not be expected, as each indicator may not be counting the same infants. The ART initiation disaggregate within HEI_POS will allow us to report a linked infant ART initiation outcome for each positive infant reported. For more information, see section on ""How to review for data quality."" 

Proxy positivity: When quarterly time period results are aggregated, PMTCT_HEI_POS (numerator) may be able to be compared to PMTCT_EID (numerator) for a proxy positivity calculation. This comparison will provide a poor proxy for positivity for sites or areas with a high percent of test results that are unknown. Combining quarters of data for both PMTCT_HEI_POS and PMTCT_EID for this comparison may reduce the portion of test results that are unknown, especially for infants whose sample was collected near the end of a reporting period. It is also important to note that infants reported under HEI_POS will not be exactly the same as infants reported through PMTCT_EID in the quarterly time period for several reasons: 1) PMTCT_EID is limited to first virologic tests whereas HEI_POS reports infants identified on a first or subsequent test 2) PMTCT_EID is limited to infants with a first virologic test sample collected during the reporting period; whereas PMTCT_HEI_POS includes infants whose positive diagnosis was established during the reporting period, but their sample could have been collected in the prior period. 

Birth cohort monitoring: HIV status of infants at the end of the breastfeeding period and the outcomes of the PMTCT program are measured in the PMTCT Final Outcome indicator, PMTCT_FO. 

This indicator reports HIV-infected infants identified by virologic HIV testing on any sample collected by 12 months of age: DNA PCR testing of dried blood spots (DBS) or point of care (POC) (e.g., Alere, Xpert) virologic testing. 

**Limitations and Considerations**:
* This indicator does not collect infants with a negative virologic test result or the number of infants whose test result is unknown. As such, “percent unknown” cannot be calculated through the MER indicator, though it is still an important metric for program monitoring. Notifying caregivers of infant test results remains important. 
* The infants reported as tested under the revised MER 2.2 PMTCT_EID indicator are not necessarily the same infants whose positive results would be reported under the new HEI_POS indicator. Dividing HEI_POS by PMTCT_EID will not provide a precise measure of positivity; however, a proxy positivity could be calculated over a longer time period. See “How to Review for Data Quality” for more information.","This indicator should be collected from the **clinical source** (i.e., HIV-exposed infant registers or patient records) to ensure unduplicated patient counting and patient care. HIV-exposed infant registers should be used to count HIV-infected infants whose results were returned in the reporting period and the age at the time of sample collection. (If available, information could come from electronic systems). If the standard report does not contain all the required information, individual patient files should be used. Additional supporting information for this indicator can be obtained from standard laboratory information systems (i.e., DNA PCR or POC/near POC log books or electronic systems) however, it will be important to ensure that repeat tests of the same sample or HIV-infected infants receiving a confirmatory virologic HIV test result are not counted twice. 

Only HIV-infected infants identified as infected by a virologic HIV test on a sample collected when they were between ages 0 through 12 months should be included in this indicator. Infants who initially were identified negative from a first virologic test but who were later identified as HIV-infected after a later virologic test should be included, as long as the infant was still aged 12 months or less at the time of sample collection. Currently, the most commonly used form of virologic testing or nucleic acid testing (“NAT”) is HIV DNA PCR on dried blood spots (DBS) but this indicator also includes HIV- infected infants identified through POC testing (e.g., Alere, Xpert). Serologic testing or “rapid” testing cannot diagnose HIV infection in an infant and so infants with a positive serologic test result and either no virologic test result or a negative virologic test result should not be included; however, infants with a positive serologic test and a positive virologic test result should be included. 

The numerator is divided into HIV-infected infants who had their diagnostic sample collected for virologic testing between birth and 2 months of age and those whose diagnostic sample was collected between 2 and 12 months of age. The 0- ≤2 month and 2-12-month time periods are based on **age at sample collection** for virologic HIV testing, not on date of result available to the facility or caregiver. HIV-infected infants should be reported in the quarterly time period in which they are identified, even if the sample was collected/sent in the previous quarter; their age should be reported by age at the time of collection of the sample that produced the positive result, and not the age when the result was available to the site. 

**Example scenario to clarify time period and age:** an infant has a DBS collected in quarter 3, aged 11 months. Due to long turnaround times, the positive result returns to the site in quarter 4 and staff now identify him/her as HIV-infected at 13 months old. This infant should be counted in quarter 4 as HIV-infected, and his/her age should be reported as 11 months (2-12mo age band). 

**ART initiation:** An additional disaggregate of the numerator is that the HIV positive infant is confirmed as having initiated ART. An HIV-infected infant reported as “ART initiation confirmed” should have documentation of an ART regimen in their record. An HIV-infected infant whose record includes documentation of “referred to ART” or an ART clinic number without evidence of receipt of an ART regimen should not be reported as “ART initiation confirmed.” ART does **not** include infant ARV prophylaxis regimens for PMTCT.","**Linkage and ART Initiation:** 
* Compare the PMTCT_HEI_POS ART initiation confirmed (disaggregate) to the PMTCT_ HEI_POS numerator to calculate linkage to ART. Significantly <100% or >100% linkage of HIV-infected infants to ART may reflect referrals to different sites, program weakness, or poor data quality and requires review to confirm. 
* TX_NEW comparison: HEI_POS_ART disaggregate is expected to be close in value to TX_NEW age <1; however, some discrepancies could be expected and significant discrepancies should be reviewed to confirm. These values may differ in part because the age disaggregate definitions for these indicators differs. TX_NEW age is based on age at ART initiation, while PMTCT_HEI_POS is based on age at virologic sample collection. Scenario: An infant’s virologic sample was collected when the infant was 11 months old near the end of Q1. The infant’s positive result was available to the site in Q2 and she started ART in Q2 at 13 months of age. Under PMTCT_HEI_POS in Q2, she would be reported as “Positive, ART initiation confirmed, age 2-12mo;” however, under TX_NEW in Q2 she would be reported in the 1-9-year age group. 
**Proxy positivity:** it is useful to review proxy positivity (PMTCT_HEI_POS / PMTCT_EID) across sites or locations to identify potential outliers for further review. Summing multiple quarters of data is recommended, as quarter-specific comparisons may provide a less accurate proxy. See “How to use” section for more considerations.",Sum results across quarters.,"**Numerator:**

There is a risk of double counting as a pregnant woman could be tested multiple times during one pregnancy therefore partners should ensure a data collection and reporting system is in place to minimize double counting including a longitudinal ANC register (meaning a register that is able to record all information about one pregnancy in one location, with rows or columns that allow for recording information on multiple visits during that pregnancy). There is also a risk of undercounting if those women who already knew their HIV status prior to attending ANC are not documented, therefore the ANC register should at a minimum should document both “previously known positive” and “newly tested positive”. Finally, “known negative” (i.e., women who tested HIV negative prior to current pregnancy) is not reported in DATIM however it may be appropriate to report “known negative” women as part of the numerator if: 1) National guidelines do not require retesting women known to be HIV negative (often women tested in the last 3 months, however exact timing depends on local guidelines) and 2) ANC registers and reporting systems only capture 1st month or 1st ANC visit.

Women who are newly tested at a different service delivery point (e.g., labor and delivery (L&D), postnatal clinics, family planning clinics, etc.) should be reported under the appropriate facility-based HTS modality (inpatient, PITC-other, etc.).

Retesting of HIV-negative women during pregnancy, at L&D and through the postpartum period is an important program strategy, but is not captured in the PMTCT_STAT indicator. Country teams should collect this data at the country level if it is pertinent to their country’s epidemic, especially in high HIV burden settings and where there are concerns of ongoing transmission during the pregnancy and postpartum period.","Assuming site level records avoid double counting (as described above) across the annual reporting cycle, sum numerator and denominator across all reporting periods for the annual result.","**Numerator:** Number of pregnant women with known HIV status at first antenatal care visit (ANC1) (includes those who already knew their HIV status prior to ANC)

This indicator provides information on coverage of the first step in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) cascade. High coverage enables early initiation of care and treatment for HIV-positive mothers. The total number of identified HIV-positive women provides the facility-specific number of pregnant women with HIV to start a facility-based PMTCT cascade. This indicator is harmonized with GARPR indicators 3.4 (https://aidsreportingtool.unaids.org/static/docs/GARPR_Guidelines_2016_EN.pdf). 

For the numerator and denominator: The data source is ANC, PMTCT and L&D program monitoring tools, such as patient registers and summary reporting forms. 

Numerator: Count all women who were enrolled in ANC during the 12-month reporting period whose HIV status is known positive, or who received an HIV test result (positive or negative) during ANC. Reconcile with all women in the L&D register who whose date of delivery was in the 12 months reporting period and whose HIV status at L&D was known positive, or who received an HIV test result (positive or negative) at ANC or L&D to avoid double counting. 

The numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1) The number of women with known (positive) HIV infection attending ANC for a new pregnancy over the last reporting period 
2) The number of women attending ANC, L&D who were tested for HIV and received results 

The numerator can be summed from categories a-d below: 
a) Number of pregnant women with unknown HIV status attending ANC who received an HIV test and result during the current pregnancy 
b) Pregnant women with known HIV infection attending ANC for a new pregnancy 
c) Number of pregnant women with unknown HIV status attending L&D who received an HIV test and result during their current pregnancy 
d) Women with unknown HIV status attending postpartum services within 72 hours of delivery who were tested for the first time in the current pregnancy and received results. 

A “status” is defined as a confirmed test result from a test during this pregnancy (either positive or negative) or already known HIV infection at antenatal clinic entry. An indeterminate test result should not be counted or reported as a part of this indicator. For the denominator: Count all women who were enrolled in ANC during the 12-month reporting period OR delivered at the facility (recorded in the L&D register), reconciling the latter with the former using the ANC No. to avoid double counting. 

As per global guidance (see GARPR indicator 3.4, link above), it is expected that the national program can reconcile information collected from ANC with L&D records. However, in MER 2.0 the PEPFAR indicator for PMTCT_ART has been simplified to collect information only at antenatal care (ANC) sites to better align with 2016 WHO Consolidated ARV guidelines, reduce burden on data collection, and improve data quality. Therefore, in reporting this indicator PEPFAR operating units should 1) utilize the national system whether it is able avoid double counting or not and are not expected to collect or report this information through a separate system 2) if it this is not possible to report individuals from both ANC and L&D, please include an explanation in the narrative whether the data is from ANC, L&D and/or both.

It may also help inform coverage of PEPFAR-supported programming for priority populations when reliable population size estimates are included as the denominator. 

_**Priority populations:**_ Priority populations should be defined by each country in the indicator narrative and must have a documented HIV prevalence or incidence greater than the general population of the country. Groups that might be counted as priority populations include: 
* Adolescent girls and young women 
* Clients of sex workers 
* Military and other uniformed services 
* Mobile populations (e.g., migrant workers, truck drivers) 
* Non-injecting drug users 

_**Size estimation:**_ The IP/country team will estimate the size of each of the priority populations in the geographic areas where the IP will implement the program. These areas are chosen based upon epidemiological data with attention to avoiding duplication of activities with those funded by donors (estimating the catchment area should be explained in the narratives). 

_**Package of interventions:**_ Together with the IP, the country team designs a set of interventions for each of the priority populations. In a defined catchment area for the specific priority population, all prevention interventions may not be offered by one IP. However, all required intervention must be available in the catchment area for the priority population. Interventions must adhere to written protocols, include goals and activities, and be designed to promote adoption of key behaviors that support HIV prevention and service uptake among the priority population(s). The interventions should comprise multiple encounters with the same individuals or groups. 

HIV testing services (HTS) or referring an individual to HTS is required to be offered (at least once during the reporting period and/or in accordance with WHO/national guidance) unless the individual had previously been tested positive for HIV. If the individual is self-identified as HIV positive, then HTS provision or referral to HTS will not be a required element of this indicator. 

The table below lists the interventions that must be offered in addition to HTS (or HTS referral). 

**Required Interventions for Adult Populations**
* Promotion of relevant prevention and clinical services and demand creation to increase awareness, acceptability, and uptake of these services. 
* Information, education, and skills development to: reduce HIV risk and vulnerability; correctly identify HIV prevention methods; adopt and sustain positive behavior change; and promote gender equity and supportive norms and stigma reduction. 
* Referral to or provision of HIV testing; facilitated linkage to care and prevention services; and/or support services to promote use of, retention in, and adherence to care. 
* Condom and lubricant (where feasible) promotion, skills building, and facilitated access to condoms and lubricant (where feasible) through direct provision or linkages to social marketing and/or other service outlets. 

**Required Interventions for Youth Populations** 
* Promotion of relevant youth-friendly prevention and clinical services and demand creation to increase awareness, acceptability, and uptake of these services. 
* Information, education and skills development to: reduce HIV risk and vulnerability; correctly identify HIV prevention methods; adopt and sustain positive behavior change; and promote gender equity and supportive norms and stigma reduction. 
* Referral to or provision of HIV testing; facilitated linkage to care and prevention services; and/or support services to promote use of, retention in, and adherence to care. 
* Condom and lubricant (where feasible) promotion, skills training, and facilitated access to condoms and lubricant (where feasible) through direct provision or linkages to social marketing and/or other youth-friendly, community-based service outlets. 
* Programs targeting adults to raise awareness of HIV risks for young people, promote positive parenting and mentoring practices, and effective adult- child communication about sexuality and sexual risk reduction.","Data collection requires reliable tracking systems that are designed to count the number of one-on-one encounters or participation in group interventions and that reduce double-counting of individuals in a reporting period. Data should be collected at every encounter/point of service and aggregated in time for PEPFAR reporting cycles. This indicator only counts those interventions at the individual and/or group level. 

A partner may count an individual (with unknown HIV sero-status or self-identified as HIV negative) as having received a prevention intervention if they have provided HTS and/or referral to HTS _**AND**_ at least one of the other listed prevention interventions during the reporting period. If an individual is already known to be HIV positive at the time of service delivery, s/he should receive at least one of the interventions listed in the table (outside of HTS) to qualify as being counted under this indicator. 

Tracking systems must be able to reduce double-counting of individuals in a reporting period. _**An individual will be reported when he/she first receives any of the required interventions in the reporting period; if the same individual receives any subsequent interventions during the same reporting period they will be reported as a returning beneficiary and not counted again in the reporting period.**_ 

Furthermore, _**de-duplication of all returning beneficiaries within the Q3-Q4 reporting period (April 1 – September 30) will also need to take place in Q4 reporting if they had already been counted under PP_PREV in Q1-Q2 of the same fiscal year.**_ For example, if an individual had received prevention interventions under PP_PREV through PEPFAR- supported program in January 2017 and was counted as being reached in FY17 Q2 reporting cycle, and this same individual was later reached with prevention services again by PEPFAR-supported program in June 2017, that individual should _**NOT**_ be reported again in the FY17 Q4 reporting period. This de-duplication is critical to accurately track the **ANNUAL** number of unique individuals reached by PEPFAR within a given fiscal year. Trend analysis of past performance PP_PREV data will be adversely affected with the change in frequency of PP_PREV reporting from annually to semi- annually if this de-duplication is ignored (i.e., annual number of PP_PREV reported within the same fiscal year would be inflated as the same individual would be counted twice if this de-duplication does not occur at Q4 reporting). 

If possible, a unique identifier should be assigned to program participants or names can be collected to track individual participation in the prevention interventions/sites. 

Site (facility and community) level system should maintain accurate registers for each individual priority population, and sum these individual populations when reporting this indicator.","Data should be reviewed regularly for the purposes of program management, to monitor progress towards achieving targets, and to identify and correct any data quality issues.

This measure is critical to assess progress in the program’s response to the epidemic in specific geographic areas, and the uptake and utility of PrEP among persons at substantially increased risk of HIV infection. 

This indicator permits monitoring trends in use, but does not attempt to distinguish between different modes or regimens of PrEP or to measure the cost, quality or effectiveness of PrEP provided. These will each vary within and between countries and are liable to change over time. 

PrEP has been shown to reduce incident infections among several populations including serodiscordant heterosexual couples, MSM, FSW, and transgender people (TG). The WHO now recommends that oral PrEP containing tenofovir should be offered as an additional prevention choice for people at substantial risk, defined as HIV incidence > 3/100 person-years.","The numerator can be generated by counting the number of people who are newly enrolled on PrEP in the reporting period, in accordance with national guidelines (or WHO/UNAIDS standards). NEW is a state defined by an individual’s beginning in a PrEP program. It is expected that the characteristics of new clients are recorded at the time they newly initiate into a program. Patients are “new” on PrEP only if they are naive to antiretroviral therapy for prevention of HIV infection and have not received oral or topical prophylaxis previously in any program. 

Reporting of the key population disaggregation should be consistent with what is described under the KP_PREV “How to review for data quality” section on mutual exclusivity of an individual who falls under multiple KP categories (e.g., FSW who injects drugs).

Checking this frequently can help to avoid stock-outs through active supply chain management. 

A view of each level of the system (Central and Intermediate sites), using this metric can also help to locate bottlenecks within the system, which could prevent patients from receiving needed commodities; cause needless stock-outs, or unnecessary expiries.   ","The country’s supply chain standard operating procedures should outline the min and max levels for each level of the system. These levels were defined by the needed throughput (the amount of pharmaceuticals intended to flow through the system in a given period), the space available and the frequency of distribution. 

Observations of storage site and level-specific quantity of stock should be available through one or several of the following: The Procurement Planning and Monitoring Report for HIV and FP commodities (for condoms), a warehouse monitoring system, regular program monitoring reports, an existing logistics management information system, stock status reports/stock keeping records/regular physical counts, order forms from the central/regional/district/other levels, or regular supervision visits. 

For the required central level and at least one intermediate level, there may be numerous observations (through physical counts performed or spot checks) of stock status for the products of interest annually, or there may be monthly counts, either way, the stock status will be monitored closely and updated with each transaction.

* Document observations for each product of interest. 
* Sort observations for each product into “quantities between maximum and minimum quantities/months of stock” and quantities above or below maximum and minimum.

Count the number of adults and children who are currently receiving ART in accordance with the nationally approved treatment protocol (or WHO/UNAIDS standards) at the end of the reporting period. 

The current on ART count should equal the number of adults and children with HIV infection who ever started ART minus those patients who are not currently on treatment at the end of the reporting period.

    * Are already on ART at the beginning of the current pregnancy 

Patients excluded from the Current on ART count are patients who died, stopped treatment, transferred out, or are lost to follow-up (LTFU). LTFU is defined as a patient who has not received ARVs in the last 90 days (three months) following their last missed appointment or missed drug pick-up. (Note: As models of service delivery change to reflect longer visit intervals for stable patients, it is important to emphasize the definition of LTFU applies to both missed visits or missed drug pick-up, but does not apply who have not received ARVs in the last 90 days (three months) following their last attended appointment or attended drug pick-up. As that interval between scheduled visits for stable patients maybe longer than 3 months.) 

This indicator should be reported from both PEPFAR-supported sites in the private or public sector. Patients currently receiving treatment from mobile clinics can be reported in two ways. Firstly, if the mobile clinic is associated (receives commodities, reports to, is staff by) a nearby health facility, then these individuals should be reported by that facility. Secondly, if a mobile clinic is stationary for more than 2 reporting periods, it should be added to the PEPFAR facility list with geocodes and data should be reported for this mobile clinic directly. 

**For age /sex disaggregates:** CURRENT is a state defined by treatment status when last seen, so it is expected that characteristics of these clients would be updated each time they are seen by a program. Age represents an individual’s age at the end of the reporting period or when last seen at the facility. For example, a 14-year-old child will be counted as currently receiving treatment in the <15 age category at the end of reporting period “A”. During reporting period “B” the child turns age 15 and so at the end of this reporting period the child will be counted under the 15+ age category.

The number of adults and children receiving treatment can be obtained through data from facility- based antiretroviral therapy registers or drug supply management systems. Data should be collected continuously and aggregated on a monthly or quarterly basis to obtain subnational and national totals. The most recent full year of data should be used for annual reporting. Data should be collected from health facility recording and reporting forms, program data, health information system. 

This indicator can be generated by counting the number of adults and children receiving antiretroviral therapy at the end of the reporting period. This value should equal the number of adults and children who have ever started antiretroviral therapy minus those not currently on treatment prior to the end of the reporting period. This will exclude those who died, stopped treatment or were lost to follow-up during the year. 

Some people pick up several months of antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) at one visit, which could cover the last months of the reporting period. Efforts should be made to include these people in the numerator as receiving antiretrovirals even if they do not attend the clinic in the last month of the reporting period. When disaggregating the numerator by age, people receiving antiretroviral therapy should be reported in the relevant age category based on their age at the end of the reporting year. HIV- positive pregnant women who are on antiretroviral therapy should be included in the numerator. 

People receiving antiretroviral therapy in the private and public sectors should be included where data are available.",,,,,,This data should be entered in DATIM by the USG country team.,"Host country teams often set targets by OU, and SNU level to plan their programs (please describe the target setting process that the host country employs in the narratives). Targets should align with the 90-90-90 UNAIDS HIV response initiative.

This measure is critical to monitor along with number of patients currently on ART in relation to the number of PLHIV that are estimated to be eligible for treatment to assess progress in the program’s response to the epidemic in specific geographic areas and populations as well as at the national level. This is particularly critical in the context of current revisions to country-specific ART eligibility. 

Reporting the number of new patients enrolled on ART at both the national and overall PEPFAR program levels is critical to monitoring the HIV services cascade, specifically the successful linkage between HIV diagnosis and initiating ART. Disaggregation of new on ART by age/sex at ART initiation, pregnancy status at ART initiation, and breastfeeding status at ART initiation is important to understand the percentage of new ART initiations coming from priority populations.","Facility ART registers/databases, program monitoring tools, or drug supply management systems. 
* The numerator can be generated by counting the number of adults and children who are newly enrolled in ART in the reporting period, in accordance with the nationally approved treatment protocol (or WHO/UNAIDS standards). 
* Patients who known to transfer in from another facility, or who temporarily stopped therapy and have started again should not be counted as new patients. 
* **NEW is a state defined by an individual initiating ART during the reporting period. It is expected that the characteristics of new clients are recorded at the time they newly initiate life-long ART. For example, patients who receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), short term ART only for prevention (PREP), or _ART starter pack alone should not be used to count individuals reached with this indicator._** 

TB/ HIV disaggregation: At initiation of ART, number of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of TB (new and relapsed) and/or on TB treatment collected from TB/HIV registers; 

Pregnant/BF disaggregation: Women who initiate ART while breastfeeding should be counted under this indicator but not in PMTCT_ART. Women who initiate during pregnancy and are reported under PMTCT_ART should also be reported here. 

Key population disaggregation* see Appendix 1 to support the identification of key populations at ART initiation. However, reporting of key population disaggregation should be consistent with what is described under the KP_PREV “How to review for data quality” section on mutual exclusivity of an individual who falls under multiple KP categories (e.g., FSW who injects drugs). In such instances, the individual should only be reported in ONE KP disaggregation category with which s/he is most identified in order to avoid double-counting.

Where electronic systems do not exist patient registers can be used to count patients and VL collected/sent VL test (denominator) or VL results (numerator). If the standard registers or reports do not contain all the required information, individual patient files should be reviewed. To determine if a lab test was collected/sent additional supporting information for this indicator can be obtained from standard laboratory information systems (including electronic systems or paper-based registries or logbooks), but the viral load test submission and result must be able to be linked to specific patient. 

VL results should be reported for patients who have been on ART for at least 3 months. It is important to ensure that the data sources used to collect and aggregate data are updated to be able to report VL results data for patients who have been on ART for at least three months. 

**NOTE:** IF the patient file does not include this information (collected/sent VL test or VL results) but the information was reported from the laboratory information system; then it is strongly recommended that IP ensure that this information is transcribed to the patient file for improved quality care and treatment services. 

This indicator should be reported for all PEPFAR supported treatment sites (reported TX_CURR and TX_NEW) with VL monitoring to promote site level use and reporting of patient viral suppression information.

* As models of service delivery change to reflect longer visit intervals for stable patients, it is important to emphasize the definition of LTFU applies to both missed visits or missed drug pick-up, but does not apply who have not received ARVs in the last 90 days (three months) following their last attended appointment or attended drug pick-up. As that interval between scheduled visits for stable patients maybe longer than 3 months. 
* Age disaggregations updated (MER 2.0 v2.1 to v2.2).",Facility,Annually,"This indicator measures the proportion of individuals who have been retained on antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART is viewed by the scientific community and PEPFAR not only as essential for decreasing morbidity and mortality, but also as a highly effective approach to prevent HIV transmission. High retention is one important measure of program success, specifically in reducing morbidity and mortality, and is a proxy for overall quality of the ART program. Monitoring the program level retention is a critical quality of service indicator at the site, national and PEPFAR program levels as it can highlight barriers to health seeking behaviors and/or gaps in access to and provision of health services.","Information should come from electronic systems (EMR) if possible. Where electronic systems do not exist ART registers/databases and cohort/group analysis forms can be used to count patients that have been retained after 12, 24 or 36 months on ART. This indicator **should NOT be estimated**. This indicator should be calculated directly from information gathered in standard cohort ART registers or electronic patient level databases. 

While reporting on 24 and 36 month retention is optional for PEPFAR reporting, it is strongly recommended so that programs can have a better understanding of longer term outcomes for patients on ART. 

Sites are required to disaggregate retention by pregnancy and breastfeeding and specific age/sex disaggregates (see data element below). In order to collect this information ART registers, cohort/group analysis forms, and EMRs must document age, sex, pregnancy status, and breastfeeding status on the date of ART initiation. 

Of note, for reporting purposes a three-month grace period should be observed following drug pick-up, before concluding a patient is actually LTFU. However, while practical, if follow-up of patients is delayed until LTFU is official, the majority of clients who do not present by three months of last missed appointment/drug pick-up are very unlikely to return thereafter. Therefore, for patient management, the facility should make every effort to contact a patient as soon as s/he misses an appointment and/ or drug pick-up (by phone, via community health worker) rather than waiting for the prescribed 90 days. This is particularly important when patients are routinely seen every three to six months (a patient may not have been seen for up to nine months if the facility adheres to the waiting period before attempting contact). LTFU is an ambiguous outcome that may often include patients who have self-transferred (silent transfer, without proper documentation or referral from their original primary care facility) or have died for which there is no documentation. Every effort should be made to document the more concreate outcomes for those not on ART (i.e., died, stopped ART, transfer out) to make the information more useful. 

The numerator is defined as the number of adults and children who are still on treatment twelve months after initiating ART. 

For example, if the PEPFAR reporting period is 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017, countries will calculate this numerator by using all patients who started ART any time during the 12-month period from 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016. The 12-month outcomes are defined as 1) on ART and 2) not on ART because patient died, stopped ART or was lost to follow-up (LTFU), (including silent transfers). 

On ART is defined as those patients who had received enough ARVs to last to the end of the reporting period. See example below for more details. 
* **LTFU** is defined as a patient who has not received ARVs in the last 90 days (three months) following their last missed appointment or missed drug pick-up. 
* **Died:** Patients that are documented death during the previous 12 months period. 
* **Stopped ART:** Patient intentionally stops ART, usually, but not always in discussion with the clinical team. 
* **Known Transfers:** Patients who have transferred in with a known treatment initiation date that falls within the reporting period should be counted. Conversely, patients who transferred out of the facility should not be counted in the numerator (or denominator, see below) 

**Note:** this indicator does not collect adherence information, but only retention, therefore the numerator does not require patients to have been on ART continuously for the 12-month period. Patients may be included in the numerator (and denominator) if they have missed an appointment or drug pick-up or temporarily stopped treatment during the 12 months since initiating treatment, as long as they are recorded as still being on treatment at month 12. 

For example. A patient who started ART in September 2016 would be considered “on ART at 12 months” (in September 2017) if: 
* The patient visited the facility and received ARVs in September 2017; **OR** 
* The patient had enough ARVs to last through the end of September 2017 (month 12) based on the last drug pick-up (e.g., patient received 60 days of drug on August 15th, or patient received 90 days of drug on July 1st, etc.). 

However, the patient would NOT be considered “on ART at 12 months” if: 
* The patient did NOT have enough ARVs to last through the end of September 2017 (e.g., patient received 30 days of drug on August 1st); **OR** 
* The patient had died, transferred out, stopped ART, or was lost to follow-up at the end of September 2017. 

The denominator is defined as the number of all adults and children who were initiated on treatment in the 12-month period before the reporting period. The denominator includes those “New” on ART as well as those who “Transferred In” if they have a cohort-start date within the reporting period of interest. However, transfers-out should be taken out of both the denominator as well as the numerator. It is assumed that if a patient transfers out from an ART facility, that patient will be a “transfer in” at a new ART facility. 

For example, for the reporting period October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017, this will include all patients who started ART during the 12-month period from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016. This includes all patients, both those on ART as well as those who have died, stopped ART or were lost to follow-up (LTFU). 

Only sites that have been operational for at least 24 months prior to the end of the reporting period should report. PEPFAR country teams may use the USG FY reporting period as the timeframe for the 12-month cohort. Teams may also wish to ‘lag’ by 1-3 months the cohort-months comprising the annual cohort, in order to allow sufficient time for reporting from data sources (i.e., implementing partners and/or national systems).","* TX_RET Denominator ≥ TX_RET Numerator

This includes newly enrolling ART patients as well as those previously started on ART. 

The numerator can be generated by counting the number of screened ART patients who were diagnosed with TB and started on anti-TB therapy during the reporting period. These data should be captured in ART registers as well as additional data collection sources (e.g., facility-based TB screening registers or forms, TB specimen registers, TB microscopy result registers, GeneXpert data collection systems) that may contain relevant information (e.g., TB screening results, TB specimen testing results). Programs should modify the register as needed to easily capture this information. 

Screening for TB and/or initiation of anti-TB therapy might not happen at the same time that ART is started. For PLHIV new to HIV care, those who are diagnosed with TB are usually started on anti-TB therapy before they initiate ART (e.g., 2-8 weeks as per current recommendations). Regardless of when they occur relative to ART initiation, TB screening and initiation of TB therapy should be included for all patients who were currently on ART or who started ART at any time during the reporting period.","Only one disaggregation type is used for age (coarse disaggregates).

Patients on ART who achieve and maintain viral suppression minimize their risk of disease progression and HIV transmission.

This indicator is harmonized with GARPR indicator 4.6 (https://aidsreportingtool.unaids.org/static/docs/GARPR_Guidelines_2016_EN.pdf) 

Numerator: The numerator can be generated by counting the number of adults and children receiving antiretroviral therapy at the end of the reporting period. Count the patient if, during the reporting months, viral load has been recorded and is <1000 copies/mL. For countries with other thresholds (e.g., undetectable <50 copies/ml or <400 copies/ml), preliminary evidence from several studies suggests the proportion of those with 50 copies/ml or above and less than 1000 copies/ml is small, so no adjustment is required. The testing threshold value should be reported in the narrative for countries with thresholds other than <1000 copies/ml. 

Viral-load testing should be routine rather than episodic; for example, when treatment failure is suspected. If multiple viral-load tests are done annually for a person, only the last routine test result should be reported. Results from episodic viral loads should not be reported. If viral-load testing coverage is less than 75% of those receiving antiretroviral therapy in the reporting year, results should be interpreted with caution. 

Tools for measuring viral load may vary across countries. Routine viral-load suppression tests from clinical and program data should be reported where available. In countries where such data are not available, results from HIV population-based surveys or drug- resistance surveys based on a random sample of people on antiretroviral therapy may be reported. Countries should report the source of the numerator and denominator data, and data from both sources should be reported if available, although clinical and program data are preferred. If results from a survey are used, that should be included when reporting. 

Where clinical and program data are available from routine monitoring systems, results will be recorded in patient files or in a laboratory system. Data should be de-duplicated where patients receive multiple viral-load tests in a year. 

If an HIV population-based or drug-resistance survey is used in place of routine program monitoring data, measurement of viral load should be done for the entire population of HIV- positive individuals where ARV is detected in specimens. Self-reported treatment status has been shown to be of limited quality. Therefore, viral-load estimates among those who report receiving antiretroviral therapy should not be used.",,,,,,This data should be entered in DATIM by the USG country team.,"Host country teams often set targets by OU level.

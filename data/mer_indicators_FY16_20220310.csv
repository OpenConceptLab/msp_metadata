* This indicator uses the number of people receiving post-GBV clinical services to measure service uptake. An increase in the number of people receiving post-GBV care will indicate that more patients are disclosing violence to providers and using the available services.

* GBV is defined as any form of violence that is directed at an individual based on his or her biological sex, gender identity or expression, or his or her perceived adherence to socially-defined expectations of what it means to be a man or woman, boy or girl. It includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse; threats; coercion; arbitrary deprivation of liberty; and economic deprivation, whether occurring in public or private life.
",Number of people receiving post-Gender Based Violence (GBV) clinical services minimum package.,"_Definitions_

* Gender: Gender is not interchangeable with women or sex. It is a culturally-defined set of economic, social, and political roles, responsibilities, rights, entitlements obligations, associated with being female and male, as well as the power relations between and among women and men, boys and girls.

* GBV: For PEPFAR, GBV is defined as any form of violence that is directed at an individual based on his or her biological sex, gender identity or expression, or his or her perceived adherence to socially-defined expectations of what it means to be a man or woman, boy or girl. It includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse; threats; coercion; arbitrary deprivation of liberty; and economic deprivation, whether occurring in public or private life. It can affect women and girls, men and boys, and other gender identities. PEPFAR is most likely to address physical and sexual intimate partner violence, including marital rape; sexual assault or rape; female genital cutting/mutilation; sexual violence against children and adolescents; and child marriage.

* Because of the challenges associated with ascertaining whether a person who experienced sexual violence did so because of their biological sex, gender identity, or his or her perceived adherence to socially defined norms of masculinity and femininity, ALL persons who experience sexual violence and present for care, independent of the cause, or of age and sex, should be counted under this indicator.

NOTE: This indicator DOES NOT include GBV Prevention activities or non-clinical community-based GBV response (e.g., shelter programs, case management).

This indicator will enable PEPFAR to:

* To determine the number of individuals that are suffering from GBV and reporting to clinical partners

* To assess whether post-GBV clinical services are being used.

* Gain an understanding of the uptake of post-GBV clinical services offered across PEPFAR countries.

* Provide important information to key stakeholders about PEPFAR programs that mitigate women and girls’ and other marginalized populations’ vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.

* Support efforts to assess the impact of post-GBV clinical services by correlating the reach (i.e., number of people served) of these services over time with outcomes related to GBV (and HIV/AIDS), as described through other data collection efforts such as survey data (DHS/PHIA/VACS).

* Identify programmatic gaps by analyzing the number and ages of people receiving services, as well as the reach of services in particular geographic areas.
","Data sources are standard program monitoring tools, such as forms, log books, spreadsheets and databases that national programs and/or partners develop or already use.

Data should be collected continuously at the point of service delivery (i.e., ANC, PMTCT, ART etc) and aggregated in time for PEPFAR reporting cycles.

The indicator can be generated by counting the number of persons receiving post-GBV clinical care, disaggregated by the age group and sex of the client receiving the service, as well as the type of service (sexual violence or emotional/physical violence) and PEP provision (see below for disaggregation information).

To adequately capture the provision of these services, logs and monitoring forms will need to be used wherever the services are offered. These forms will need to track both the outcome of the initial assessment and the provision of referrals or services. For PEP specifically, registries should collect both the administration of the PEP as well as its completion and the patient’s adherence.

Special considerations:

* As outlined in the Program Guide for Integrating GBV Prevention and Response in PEPFAR Programs all programs seeking to address GBV must first and foremost protect the dignity, rights, and well-being of those at risk for, and survivors of, GBV. There are four fundamental principles for integrating a GBV response into existing programs and specific actions for putting these principles into practice. These principles are as follows:

    * Do no harm

    * Privacy, confidentiality, and informed consent

    * Meaningful engagement of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and GBV survivors

    * Accountability and M&E

Violence Service Type

* SEXUAL Violence; PHYSICAL and/or EMOTIONAL Violence

    1. Sexual violence (post-rape care): Although guidelines for post-rape care will vary from country to country, in addition to treatment of serious or life-threatening medical issues (e.g., lacerations, broken bones) and the necessary forensic interviews and examinations, the minimum package of post-rape care services should always begin with an assessment of the client’s specific needs.

    The following represents the Minimum Package for post-rape care services that must be in place to count under this indicator:

    * Provision of Clinical Services: (all of the following must be in place, including relevant commodities, and ability to count individuals— independent of whether individuals use the specific service)

        * Rapid HIV testing with referral to care and treatment as appropriate

        * Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV -- if person reached within the first 72 hours

        * STI screening/testing and treatment

        * Emergency contraception, where legal and in accordance with national guidelines – if person reached within the first 72 hours (note that PEPFAR funds cannot be used to procure EC)

        * Counseling (other than counseling for testing, PEP, STI and EC)

2.	Physical and/or emotional violence (other Post-GBV care): GBV can take many forms, and includes physical and emotional violence. The following services should be available for persons who have experienced GBV that is not sexual. Services should always begin with an assessment of the client’s specific needs and include, as appropriate. The following represents the Minimum Package for other post-GBV care services that must be in place to count under this indicator:

    * Provision of Clinical Services: (all of the following must be in place and available to count persons—independent of whether people use the specific service)

        * Rapid HIV testing with referral to care and treatment as appropriate (Please note that individuals should also be counted under the MER HIV testing and counseling indicator (i.e., # of individuals who received HIV testing and counseling services and received their results).

        * STI screening/testing and treatment

        * Counseling (other than for HIV counseling and testing)

    For both Sexual violence and Physical and/or emotional violence: These cannot be counted for the indicator alone, however where applicable should be offered:

        * Longer-term psycho-social support (e.g., peer support groups)

        * Legal counsel

        * Police

        * Child protection services

[Disagg of Violence Service Type SEXUAL] PEP

* Number of people receiving PEP services (related to sexual violence services provided)

    * Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): PEP service provision should only be counted under this indicator if the individual receives PEP treatment (i.e., drugs) in accordance with international and/or national protocols, guidelines, etc., and if the individual completes the full course of treatment. If an individual is provided with PEP, completes the full course of treatment (and meets the other criteria detailed within this indicator reference sheet) the individual should be counted under this GBV care indicator. The individual should not be additionally counted under other MER treatment indicators (e.g., # of individuals new on ART; # of individuals ever on ART, etc.) PEP is intended to prevent HIV infection, while other MER treatment indicators monitor ARV provision to those who are HIV positive.

Data should be collected continuously at the institution level (or community level). Data analysis and review should be done regularly to monitor progress towards achieving the targets, and to identify and correct any data quality issues.",It is widely acknowledged that the lack of trained health workers is a major barrier to scaling up health services. The lack of a sufficient workforce in countries presents a serious challenge to every area of health. The data will tell us the number of new health workers who are available to enter the health workforce each year as a result of PEPFAR support.,"Training under this indicator is defined as “pre-service” training – the training of “new” health workers (see definition below). Training generally occurs prior to the individual entering the health workforce in his or her new position (with the exception of certain training that may occur on-the job but that prepares health workers to function as a new cadre or with an expanded scope of practice in the health system). A health worker who advances to a higher cadre (e.g., a clinical assistant who completes training to become a clinical officer) shall be counted as a “new” health worker for the purposes of this indicator. The HRH goal is to expand the number of workers in the workforce and increase access to care through the advancement of current workers to higher level cadres through additional training and education.

Pre-service training institutions are university-based or affiliated schools/institutions of medicine, nursing, public health, social work, laboratory science, pharmacy, and other health-related fields. Non-professional or paraprofessional training would be any accredited and nationally recognized pre-service program that is a requirement for this cadre’s entry into the workforce.

“In-service” and “continuing education” training should _not_ be included in the count for this indicator, but continue to be encouraged.

In order to count the duration of training must meet or exceed a minimum of 6 months. For example, community health workers who receive a 3-month training course cannot be counted here. The training duration may be a combination of classroom and practical field time to arrive at six months. Individuals may be in training over many reporting periods; however, only participants who have successfully completed their training should be counted.

A pre-service training program must be nationally accredited, or at the minimum meet national and international standards. The program must also have specific learning objectives, a course curriculum, expected knowledge, skills, and competencies to be gained by participants, as well as documented minimum requirements for course completion. The duration and intensity of training will vary by cadre; however, all training programs should have at a minimum the criteria listed above.

Successful completion of training may be documented by diploma, certificate or other evidence of completion of the program and subsequent eligibility to enter service.

Individuals not meeting these documented requirements should not be counted in this indicator.

“Health workers” refers to individuals involved in safeguarding and contributing to the prevention, promotion and protection of the health of the population (both professional and auxiliary-professionals). The categories below describe the different types of health workers to be considered under this indicator. This is not an exhaustive list of all health workers and position titles may vary from country to country.

For the purposes of this indicator, health workers may include the following but is not limited to:

* Clinical professionals, including doctors, nurses, midwives, laboratory scientists, pharmacists, medical technologists, and psychologists. They usually have a tertiary education and most countries have a formal method of certifying their qualifications.

* Clinical officers, medical and nursing assistants, lab and pharmacy technicians, auxiliary nurses, auxiliary midwives, T&C counselors. They should have completed a diploma or certificate program according to a standardized or accredited curriculum and support or substitute for university-trained professionals.

* Workers in a health ministry, hospital and facility administrators, human resource managers, monitoring and evaluation advisors, epidemiologists and other professional staff critical to health service delivery and program support.

* Social service workers including social workers, child and youth development workers, social welfare assistants.

PEPFAR support includes funding in the areas of curriculum development, teacher training and support, tuition/scholarships, infrastructure, materials/equipment, and practica/internships. For example, full or partial support of student tuition or scholarships, teacher salaries, and expansion/refurbishment of pre-service training facilities could all count under this indicator depending on the investment.

1. PEPFAR is supporting the training of new health worker graduates, including:

    * Tuition and fees - At least 50% of the students' tuition and fees were or will be provided by PEPFAR for at least six months of their education

The disaggregation by test result provides information about the yield of HTC and the effectiveness of HTC programs in identifying people living with HIV (PLHIV) over time.

The service delivery disaggregation is intended to monitor access to and uptake of HTC by specific populations, HIV testing yield, and HTC setting and modality. The findings can support national governments and PEPFAR programs to determine the coverage and identify gaps in HTC services. This data may also be useful for projecting programmatic commodities and system needs such as HIV test kits and other staffing resources, although individuals are counted and not the number of tests performed.
","Existing HTC registers and reporting forms that are already being used to capture HTC services could be revised to include the disaggregation categories. Examples of data collection forms include client intake forms, activity report forms, or health registers such as HIV Testing and Counseling registers, health information systems and non-governmental organization records.

Data for the numerator should be generated by counting the total number of individuals who received HTC from all service delivery points. The HTC_TST indicator includes targets and results from the following indicators when HTC services are provided as part of the intervention package:

* PMTCT_STAT

* TB_STAT

* VMMC_CIRC

* GEND_GBV

* PP_PREV

* KP_PREV

Please note that HTC-TST includes newly tested in the above modalities (for all other modalities not included in this list, for example L&D, the numbers should be included in PITC other).

Note: Serological testing among infants should be counted under the HTC_TST indicator. HIV virologic testing of HIV exposed infants should be counted under the PMTCT_EID indicator.

Service delivery settings captures testing of all age groups tested in these respective settings including pediatric and adolescent populations.

Service delivery points are defined as:

* _Community-based testing_ - Any testing outside of a designated health facility

    * Home-based testing - Including door-to-door testing and home visits

    * Mobile testing - Including any adhoc or temporary testing locations, such as a community center, school, or mobile unit (this should not include VMMC services, these should be captured until facility based testing – VMMC, even if in outreach setting)

    * Index testing - Including any index testing that is the result of a community-based testing (regardless of where the index testing occurs).

    * Other community platforms – Including drop-in centers, fixed sites that are not part of a facility, OVC program etc.

* _Facility-based testing_ – Any testing occurring inside a designated health facility

    * Inpatient - Surgery and any inpatient ward

    * Outpatient - Includes casualty, ER, and OPD
    
    * Pediatrics: Under 5/EPI (immunization or well child services) clinic (exclude virologic testing and non-diagnostic rapid HIV testing which is reported under PMTCT_EID)

    * Malnutrition – Clinics and inpatient wards predominately dedicated to the treatment of malnourished children. While this service delivery point may be part of either inpatient or outpatient services, if an individual could be reported under both malnutrition and another service delivery point, report an individual only once and under malnutrition.

    * Index testing - Including any index testing that was the result of facility-based testing (regardless of where the index testing occurs), for example, PMTCT couples testing.

    * TB clinics: This includes all patients originating from the TB clinics including TB patients and their partners/family members tested for HIV

    * VMMC – This includes HIV testing for males as part of the VMMC programs both in facility based VMMC programs and mobile outreach programs. Testing is highly recommended through the VMMC program, although not mandatory.

    * ANC – HIV testing as part of the PMTCT program at antenatal care clinics (ANC), should align with PMTCT_STAT; Antenatal Care clinics for pregnant women and their partners/family members

    * Other PITC – for examples would include L&D, family planning centers, STI, etc.

When developing or modifying existing M&E systems and tools to collect and report this indicator, the following information should be considered:

* The first priority of data collection and reporting of HTC services among key populations must be to do no harm. These data must be managed with confidentiality to ensure the identities of the individuals are protected to prevent further stigma and discrimination of key populations.

* Demographic - Client’s name, sex, and age at time of HTC services

* HIV testing and counseling - HIV test results, date of HIV test, receipt of HIV test results, previously tested during the reporting period, and type of counseling/testing

* Site - site’s name, district, region, province, and service delivery point

Patient level Deduplication, recommendation at the partner level by adding to the HTC facility and community registers (has patient been tested in the last 3 months). This additional datapoint in the patient testing registries can help partners de-duplicate at the reporting level.

Confirmatory testing should be excluded, since the individual has already been counted as having been tested positive in either this reporting period or a previous reporting period.

","Only one age disaggregation type is used for age/sex/ result received: The number of individuals receiving HTC must be disaggregated by age. Countries must use the finer age disaggregation (<1, 1-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-49, 50+). If the fine age disaggregation is not possible, with approval from HQs, countries should use the coarse age disaggregation (<15, 15+), for age/sex result received.

These interventions are based on evidence and meet the required minimum standards. This information will help PEPFAR understand the relative saturation of KP evidence-based programs.

This indicator counts those interventions at the individual and/or small-group level. Providing HTC or referring an individual to HTC is a required intervention, unless the individual has already tested positive for HIV. This information should also be captured in the   HTC_TST indicator under other (community or facility depending on the KP program), OU should also report the number of individuals tested under indicator “HTC_TST”. A partner may count an individual as having received a prevention activity if they have provided HTC testing and/or referral and one of the other listed prevention activities below. For a client to have received a comprehensive package of services, they must receive the entire list of interventions below, however these do not have to be provided by only one partner and can be provided by multiple partners working together. Therefore the interventions listed below are components of a comprehensive program, but are not by individually defined as a comprehensive program.

In order to better understand the comprehensiveness of prevention interventions being offered to each key population, PEPFAR operating units are required to report on the types of prevention interventions and/or linkages to clinical services that were provided to each key population in the Q4 narrative when reporting results to HQ.

OUs that are better positioned to set targets are encouraged to do so for COP 16.",,Semi-Annually,Report 6 months of results at Q2 and Q4.,"This indicator will be tracked through routine program monitoring and through the Q2 and Q4 reporting. PEPFAR will measure progress to ensure that OVC partners are proactively promoting HIV status knowledge as an essential part of effective OVC case management in those under 18.

Rationale:

PEPFAR OVC programs serve children who may be infected by HIV or are at high risk of becoming HIV infected, either through vertical mother-to-child transmission or horizontal/sexual transmission. OVC programs play a vital role in referring children and their parents/caregivers to HIV specific clinical services to ensure access to a continuum of care to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with HIV. This new indicator reflects the OVC program’s contribution to achieving an AIDS free generation and the first 90 of the 90-90-90 UNAIDS Strategy.

Given the elevated risk of HIV infection among children affected by and vulnerable to HIV, it is imperative for PEPFAR implementing partners to know the HIV status of the children enrolled in OVC programs. When the implementing partner knows the HIV status, the program can contribute to ensuring that the children are linked to appropriate care and treatment services, all essential elements of quality case management. In addition, it is vital for caregivers to know the status of all of the children in their care, and OVC programs can play an important role in family-centered disclosure.

* Status disclosure to the implementing partner is NOT a prerequisite for enrollment or continuation in an OVC program. OVC programs serve persons of positive, negative, and unknown HIV status appropriate to their needs.

* This indicator does not require OVC partners to report a disaggregation of known HIV test results data (positive or negative). Test results are frequently unavailable to community organizations due to health facility concerns about patient confidentiality. OUs can choose based on their unique situation whether it will be possible to report on the disclosed HIV status (positive or negative). If partner receives HTC funds, they should be reporting based on HTC specific indicators.

* The purpose of this indicator is to determine whether OVC partners are proactively promoting HIV status knowledge as an essential part of effective OVC case management and to ascertain if children in OVC programs have received appropriate HIV specific services, if needed.

","This indicator captures whether Implementing partners know whether the OVC or the caregiver knows the OVC HIV status. This indicator captures, 2 elements, firstly whether the program knows that OVC’s status and secondly whether the status has been shared with the IP (known status, positive, negative). Data sources for this indicator include registers, referral forms, client records, or other confidential case management and program monitoring tools. HIV status as is at the end of each reporting period should be reported in this indicator.

Note: This indicator is _NOT_ a testing indicator and should not reflect when and how often to test a child or adolescent. This indicator is capturing if implementing partners either know or don’t know the HIV status of the orphans and vulnerable children they serve. If children or adults are tested as part of the OVC program, this information should be added to the HTC_TST indicator, under the community based testing “other” disaggregate.
","Review any site with over 100% coverage or very low coverage to ensure they reflect expected results. The OVC_KNOWNSTAT numerator should not exceed the denominator (OVC_SERV <18 years old including “active”, “graduated”, “transferred”, and “exited without graduation”). There cannot be more OVC whose HIV status is known or unknown than there are OVC that have been served in the same reporting period.

Sum of HIV Status Disaggregates should equal the numerator. If sum of disaggregates is less than numerator, the HIV status of OVC has been missed. If sum of disaggregates is greater than numerator, OVC may have been double-counted.

Sum of Age/Sex/HIV Status Disaggregates should equal sum of HIV Status Disaggregates.",Use result reported at Q4.,"Numerator: Number of orphans and vulnerable children (<18 years old) whose HIV status is known to the PEPFAR OVC implementing partner.

Mitigating the impact that HIV is having on children and the families that support them is integral to a comprehensive HIV response. It is important to note that the definition of “affected” children includes, but is not limited to, children infected with HIV. PEPFAR recognizes that individuals, families, and communities are affected by HIV in ways that may hinder the medical outcomes of HIV-positive persons as well as the emotional and physical development of children orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS. A variety of services (per Technical Considerations 2015 and 2016) are supported through PEPFAR to mitigate these effects in order to improve health and well-being outcomes of adults and children. The goal of OVC programs is to build stability and resiliency in children and families-exposed, living with or affected by HIV/AIDS through
rigorous case management and provision and access to health and socio-economic interventions. This indicator, by disaggregating “active”, “graduated”, “transferred”, and “exited without graduation” measures how successful the OVC program is in building children and their families’ resiliency.

","The data sources are the PEPFAR OVC program registers and program data generated by implementing partners. Implementing partners’ registers need to record names of children and caregivers who meet the criteria for “active beneficiary” or “graduated” or “transferred” or “exited without graduation” to generate the number included in this indicator.

The indicator is generated by counting the number of active beneficiaries who received at least one HKID funded service from facilities and/or community -based organizations (see definition of an ‘active beneficiary’ below) and by counting the number of beneficiaries who graduated from the PEPFAR OVC program successfully and by counting the number of beneficiaries who were “transferred” to existing host-country programs and by counting the number of beneficiaries who have “exited without graduation” from the PEPFAR OVC program.

Therefore coverage at site level must be understand within the context of the service delivery model at that site. For example, in local areas where ART is integrated into ANC and low volume PMTCT sites are only testing for HIV and then referring women to other facilities for ART, the expectation is that for one individual PMTCT_STAT_POS (newly tested) will be documented at one facility and PMTCT_ART (new on ART) would be documented at another facility. However the expectation may be different in settings where ART is not integrated into the ANC site and women are referred to the care and treatment clinic after being tested at ANC.

* _The number of HIV-positive pregnant women already on ART at beginning of pregnancy_: Maybe counted even if ART is continuing to be received at another facility. For example a woman, who is already on treatment, becomes pregnant and enrolls in ANC/PMTCT because she is HIV-positive but is continuing to receive her ART at a nearby treatment clinic _should be counted_ within this disaggregate. However if a woman was initiated on ART at another facility during this pregnancy and then transfers-in to the ANC site, she _should not be counted_.

Additionally, the yield of HIV testing at 2 months of age maybe a useful proxy of mother-to-child transmission rates if coverage of testing is > 80%.","This indicator should be collected from the clinical source (ie. HIV-exposed infant registers or patient records) to assure unduplicated patient counting and receipt of results to inform patient care. HIV-exposed infant registers should be used to count exposed infants and virologic test results. (If available information should come from electronic systems). If the standard report does not contain all the required information, individual patient files should be used. Additional supporting information for this indicator can be obtained from standard laboratory information systems (ie. DNA PCR log books or electronic systems), but the virologic test results must be able to be linked to a specific patient.

Only virologic tests should be included in this indicator. A virologic test is a test used for HIV diagnosis in infants up to 18 months of age. The most commonly used form of virologic testing is HIV DNA PCR on dried blood spots (DBS). Three other types of testing should not be reported: 1) Serologic testing of children should not be reported in this indicator. (see HTC_TST for additional details). 2) Virologic tests conducted with the purpose of confirming the diagnosis of HIV, 3) Virologic tests used for clinical monitoring of children on ART, such as viral load quantification. Additionally, Infants tested should be counted once, even if they have had more than one virologic test done during the reporting period.

The numerator is divided into tests collected/sent before 2 months of age and those collected/sent between 2 and 12 months of age. Age is documented at the time the DBS is collected and not when the result is returned. It is likely that at the time of reporting there will be tests that have been collected/sent but for which no result is documented in the register or patient record. Partners should report all tests collected/sent even if no result has been recorded in the patient record/register at the time of reporting.

","Review all sites with >100% coverage of testing at 12 months and/or 100% positivity (EID_POS). In general the % tested should not be above 100% at a site, however it is possible that some women identified in PMTCT_STAT_POS might deliver within a reporting period but the infant may not receive virologic test until the following period as there is not always a 1:1 correspondence between POS women identified and infants delivered in a reporting period.

It is recommended to wait to collect the 18 month visit outcomes until the patient is 24 months old for the following reasons: 1) this allows for children who present several months late to their 18 month visit to be included in the numerator and 2) cohort reporting is easiest when monthly reporting by facilities is used and where the birth month and the reporting month are the same calendar month (i.e., for infants born in January 2012, their 24 month reporting month would be January 2014, rather than using the 18 month reporting month of July 2013).

To accomplish this goal, it is recommended to identify infants at birth or at the first infant follow-up visit and track them through the end of the breastfeeding period. This indicator measures progress toward ensuring that all infants born to HIV- positive women have an outcome documented. In settings where a mother-infant register is utilized and/or it is common practice for HIV-infected women to breastfeed less than or more than 18 months please describe in the narrative the final outcome time point.","To report on this indicator PEPFAR supported sites would ideally use registers or facility held cards for HIV exposed infants that collect longitudinal information on follow-up and are organized by birth month of infants. This methodology is referred to as birth cohort reporting.

Two examples of birth cohort reporting:

1. In Kenya, this indicator was first piloted by PEPFAR and the Ministry of Health in Western Kenya and is currently integrated into the national HIV summary reporting tool. Data from the facility HIV exposed infant longitudinal follow-up register, which organizes infants by birth-month cohorts, are aggregated into a report summarizing outcomes for infants reaching 24 months of age during each month.

2. In Malawi, clinic staff complete monthly follow up reporting forms as part of the national quarterly supervision visits using data collected directly from HIV-exposed infant cards which are kept in a binder that is organized by birth month (no HIV exposed register is used).

Both approaches allow a paper-based health facility records to quickly identify the number of HIV-exposed infants registered in the birth cohort at any time between 0 and 18 months of age (denominator).
","By design this indicator should equal 100% if all outcomes are known regardless of outcome type. This allows for facilities to check that all HIV-exposed infants have an outcome assigned to them during the reporting process. Data utilization requires reviewing the disaggregated data to understand the specific outcomes of interest. In settings where HIV-exposed infant registers do not allow for documentation of all disaggregated outcomes, country teams should report only on available disaggregates even if the aggregate indicator is less than 100%, however this should be specified in the narrative.

At the site level the denominator should include those “Transferred In” and those “Transferred Out”. The inclusion of Transfers-In/Out provides a quality check to ensure that all exposed infants have an outcome assigned to them during the reporting process such that the sum of the numerator disaggregation equals the denominator.

Outcome Type

    * For the numerator to be calculated, implementing partners are required to report:

    * HIV-infected = Number of HIV-exposed infants identified as HIV-infected at any point during follow-up. HIV-infected includes infants and children with diagnostic virologic or serologic confirmation of HIV-infection (DNA PCR before 18 months; rapid test at 18 months) and those with a presumptive HIV diagnosis where DNA PCR is not available.

    * Site should also maintain data on HIV infected infants and whether they are linked or not linked to ART services, or whether they have no information on patient linkage to ART programs.

    * HIV-uninfected = Number of HIV-exposed infants with a negative 18 month antibody test documented. Based on national guidelines, countries should determine if “HIV-uninfected” includes infants with a documented negative antibody test that was done at least 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding but before 18 months of age.

    * HIV final status unknown = Sum of the following disaggregates (not reported in DATIM but should be documented at site level)

Patients excluded from the Current on ART count are patients who died, stopped treatment, transferred out, or are lost to follow-up (i.e. patient not seen for 3 months from last visit, unless they are enrolled in a multi-month scripting program which could extend longer than 3 months).

HIV-positive pregnant women taking other ARV regimens for PMTCT only are NOT included in this indicator OR ART taken only for the purpose of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is NOT included in this indicator.

The number of adults and children with HIV infection who are currently receiving ART can be obtained through data collected from drug supply management systems (e.g., found at the pharmacy) or facility-based ART registers.

CURRENT is a state defined by treatment status when last seen, so it is expected that characteristics of these clients would be updated each time they are seen by a program.

This measure is critical to monitor along with number of patients currently on ART in relation to the number of PLHIV that are estimated to be eligible for treatment to assess progress in the program’s response to the epidemic in specific geographic areas and populations as well as at the national level. This is particularly critical in the context of current revisions to country-specific ART eligibility. Reporting the number of new patients enrolled on ART at both the national and overall PEPFAR program levels is critical to monitoring the HIV services cascade, specifically the successful linkage between HIV diagnosis and initiating ART. Disaggregation of new on ART by age/sex at ART initiation, pregnancy status at ART initiation, and breastfeeding status at ART initiation is important to understand the percentage of new ART initiations coming from priority populations.","Facility ART registers/databases, program monitoring tools, or drug supply management systems.

* Patients who transfer in from another facility, or who temporarily stopped therapy and have started again should not be counted as new patients.

* NEW is a state defined by an individual’s initiating life-long ART for the first time and are naive to lifelong treatment. It is expected that the characteristics of new clients are recorded at the time they newly initiate life-long ART. For example patients who received post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) or short term ART only for prevention of mother-to- child transmission (PMTCT) in the past would still be counted as “new” on ART once they initiate lifelong ART.

* The numerator is defined as the number of adults and children who are still alive and on treatment twelve months after initiating lifelong ART.

* For example, if the PEPFAR reporting period is 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015, countries will calculate this numerator by using all patients who started ART any time during the 12-month period from 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014. The 12-month outcomes are defined as 

    1. alive and on ART, 

    2. dead,

    3. lost to follow-up.

* The numerator does _not_ require patients to have been on ART continuously for the 12-month period. Patients may be included in the numerator (and denominator) if they have missed an appointment or drug pick-up or temporarily stopped treatment during the 12 months since initiating treatment, as long as they are recorded as still being on treatment at month 12.

* A patient who started ART in September 2014 would be considered “alive and on ART at 12 months” (in September 2015) if:

    * The patient visited the facility and received ARVs in September 2015; OR

    * The patient had enough ARVs to last through the end of September 2015 (month 12) based on the last drug pick-up (e.g., patient received 60 days of drug on August 15th, or patient received 30 days of drug on September 1st, etc.).

* However, the patient would NOT be considered “alive and on ART at 12 months” if:

    * The patient did NOT have enough ARVs to last through the end of September 2015 (e.g., patient received 30 days of drug on August 1st); AND

    * The patient was dead, transferred out, stopped, or lost to follow-up at the end of September 2015.

* At the facility level, patients who have transferred in with a known treatment initiation date that falls within the reporting period should be counted. Conversely, patients who transferred out of the facility should not be counted in that facility’s cohort. See “Explanation of Net Current Cohort” in the “Interpretation” section below for further details. The number of adults and children on ART at 12 months includes patients who have transferred in (and their initiation date is known) at any point from initiation of treatment to the end of the 12-month period and excludes patients who have transferred out during this same period to reflect the net current cohort at each facility.

","Total number of adults and children who initiated ART in the 12 months prior to the beginning of the reporting period, including those who have died, those who have stopped ART, and those lost to follow-up.

* The denominator is defined as the number of all adults and children who were initiated on treatment in the previous 12-15 months reporting period. The denominator includes those “New” on ART as well as those who “Transferred In” if they have a cohort-start date within the reporting period of interest. However, transfers-out should be taken out of both the denominator as well as the numerator. It is assumed that if a patient transfers out from an ART facility, that patient will be a “transfer in” at a new ART facility.
For example, for the reporting period October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015, this will include all patients who started ART during the 12-month period from October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014. This includes all patients, both those on ART as well as those who are dead, have stopped treatment or are lost to follow-up at month 12.

* Only sites that have been operational for at least 24 months prior to the end of the reporting period should report. PEPFAR country teams may use the USG FY reporting period as the timeframe for the 12-month cohort. Teams may also wish to ‘lag’ by 1-3 months the cohort-months comprising the annual cohort, in order to allow sufficient time for reporting from data sources (i.e., implementing partners and/or national systems).
",,,Age/Sex disaggregates aligned across clinical cascade.,Facility,Annually,Report 12 months of results at Q4,"This indicator measures the proportion of individuals who have retained on antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART is viewed by the scientific community and PEPFAR not only as essential for decreasing morbidity and mortality, but also as a highly effective approach to prevent HIV transmission. High retention is one important measure of program success, specifically in reducing morbidity and mortality, and is a proxy for overall quality of the ART program. Monitoring the program level retention is a critical quality of service indicator at the site, national and PEPFAR program levels as it can highlight barriers to health seeking behaviors and/or gaps in access to and provision of health services.

","Information should come from electronic systems (EMR) if possible. Where electronic systems do not exist ART registers/databases and cohort/group analysis forms can be used to count patients that have been retained after 12 months on ART.

This indicator should NOT be estimated. This indicator should be calculated directly from information gathered in standard cohort ART registers or electronic patient level databases.

Sites are encouraged to disaggregate retention by health status at initiation (e.g., CD4 count or WHO stage), to review the retention of every ART start up group on a continuous basis, to summarize the data at regular intervals (e.g., monthly), and to use this information to improve follow-up and retention of patients.","* TX_RET Denominator ≥ TX_RET Numerator
